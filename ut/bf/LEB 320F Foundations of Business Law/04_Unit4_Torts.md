# Unit 4: Torts

LEB 320F

**Torts**: Civil legal actions (not criminal and not breaches of contract), includes IP, etc

- *Interest* and *duty* are always kept in mind with tort law

- Tort law evolves with society, technology, etc

## Negligence

Carelessness/Accidental injury

Must prove:

1. Defendant owed plaintiff duty of due care
2. Defendant breached that duty
3. Defendant's breach caused the injury
4. Plaintiff suffered injury

### Duty

We owe a duty to every person who we can *reasonably forsee* might be injured by our carelessness

- *Otis Engineering Corp v Clark*: Is a company responsible for car collision deaths caused by one of its employees getting off from work drunk? TX Supreme Court decides that it's determined by common sense (there was an on-site nursing station, could have called the wife, etc) -- retrial by lower court

Landowning torts:

- *Trespassers* can sue only for intentional torts
- *Licensees* (right to come onto property for self-benefit, such as door-to-door salesman or neighbor) can sue for hidden dangers they should have been warned about
- *Invitees* (invited by the owner/occupier: customers, etc) can sue for any kind of tort

*Breach of duty*: Defendant must fail to exercise the same care as a "reasonable person under similar circumstances"

*Negligence per se*: If a defendant violates some kind of legislative standard (selling liquor to a drunk person or ignoring speed limit signs), it isn't necessarily negligence, but can be used in that direction

*Proximate cause*: The negligent action of the defendant is the direct cause for the plaintiff's injury

- *Causation in fact*: "Had it not been for" the negligent actions of the defendant, the injury wouldn't have taken place
  - Sometimes, just needs to be a *substantial factor* in the injury taking place
- *Reasonable foreseeability*: Did the actions of the negligent defendant have reasonable forseeability of harming the plaintiff
  - Independent Intervening Cause: Something interrupts the chain of events that lead to the injury -- not directly from defendant to plaintiff
- *Brown v Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine*: Hospital initially gave wrong diagnosis for a child having syphilis, which lead to uncovering of Mr. Brown's extramarrital affair which snowballed into other problems that broke up the marriage; Hospital not guilty bc cause was not direct and the consequences were not continually in effect until the gun went off (no proximate cause)

### Injury

Usually emotional distress due to negligence is not arguable, but starting to change a little bit if there are accompanying physical injuries or in "zone of danger" (ex: someone near you actually got hit by the car) or bystander recovery (ex: parent in the area seeing or hearing their kid get killed by the car)

### Defenses

- *Comparative fault*: Plaintiff somehow partially contributed to the accident (*contributory negligence*)
  - Some states have *comparative negligence*, where if the defendant accounted for 30% of the negligence, then the defendant gets 30% of the damages due
  - *Modified comparative negligence*: Past a certain point of liability (>50%), plaintiff can't claim anything from defendant
- *Statute of limitations*: Typically within 2 years of supposed negligence
  - Sometimes not until after plaintiff knows of the act (ex: drugs that take 2 years to show results)
- *Workers' compensation* system: Injured employees can recover benefits from employers when injured on the job regardless of emplyer fault, but forfeit right to sue employer unless gross negligence (ex: machine has injured many employees before)
- "No fault" automobile statutes: People who only suffer minor injuries in car accidents can recover only from their own insurance company up until a certain statutory threshold

## Intentional Torts

### Assault and Battery

**Battery**: Rude, inordinate contact with another person (body)

**Assault**: Creates an apprehension of an imminent battery (mind)

Must prove:

1. Defendant's affirmative conduct
2. Intent (ex: pointing an unloaded gun is still apprehension)
3. Plaintiff's injury (doesn't include threat of future contact or threat by a defendant far away)

- *Cole v State of Louisiana, Dept of Public Safety and Corrections*: Corrections officer Cole injured by use of unpadded baton in training exercise; awarded tort

#### Defenses

- Statute of limitations
- Consent (cannot be procured by fraud or misinformation)
- Self defense

### Defamation

**Libel**: Written defamation (including television and radio)

**Slander**: Oral defamation; requires proof of special damages (some sort of economic loss) except for *slander per se* (imputation of serious crime, loathsome disease, incompetence in plaintiff's profession, sexual misconduct)

#### Elements

Must prove:

1. Defendant made statement as though it were fact
  - Opinion doesn't count
2. Statement was defamatory
  - Can be made by a corporation/group, not just another person
  - Injury dissipates as the offended group gets larger
3. Statement was false
  - Defendant has the burden to prove it is true, unless they're a public figure (then they must prove it's false)
4. Statement was communicated to 1+ other people
5. Plaintiff's reputation was harmed

#### Defenses

- Statute of limitations (1 yr)
- Absolute privilege: Courtroom activities (judges, lawyers, witnesses) have absolute protection while performing their respective activities
- Qualified privileges: No malice

#### Injurious Falsehood

"Trade libel"

### False Imprisonment

Must prove:

1. Intentionally confined or restrained plaintiff
  - Can include imprisonment to some wide open area because of some threat
  - Does not include negligence (ex: accidentally locking someone in)
2. Without plaintiff's consent
3. Without lawful authority
4. "Injured" the plaintiff (plaintiff aware of deprivation of freedom of movement)

Shopkeepers are given special treatment if there's a probable cause for shoplifting

- *Walmart Stores, Inc v Cockrell*: Walmart employee made suspected shoplifter remove bandage to prove no shoplifting; Cockrell won because it was "unreasonable"
- Activation of security alarm is enough for probable cause

### Tresspass

Encroaching on the ability of another to use their real property (land and things attached to it)

Must prove:

1. Affirmative conduct by defendant
2. Intent to enter onto realty in possession of another (doesn't need to be an intent to do harm; accidentally walking onto property counts)
3. Resulting in actual entry

#### Defenses

- Statute of limitations
- Easements (specific agreements that allow some wiggle room for property)

#### Invasion of Privacy

- Intrusion: must be highly offensive to a reasonable person (ex: placing a microphone under a bed, randomly searching an employee's locked desk)
- Disclosure of embarassing private facts (only for blackmail, even if they are true)
- False light: similar to defamation, encroaches on privacy to put plaintiff in a bad public light (1 yr statute of limitations)
- Appropriation of Name or Likeness: Using without permission (often in advertising campaign)

#### Intentional Infliction of Mental Distress

- Practical jokes gone wrong, debt collection agencies crossing lines
- *GTE Southwest v Bruce*: Very abusive boss, multiple previous complaints, co did nothing about it; plaintiffs won

### Fraud

Includes half-truths, omissions, wrong intentions, but not predictions or opinion (unless fiduciary duty)

Doesn't include silence -- *caveat emptor* (buyer beware), but includes several exceptions that have started to learn towards *caveat venditor* (seller beware)

- *Milliken v Jacono*: Undisclosed deaths in the house would suppoasedly diminish a sold house's value; requiring previous disclosure about murders would have entered a very subjective area, not an objective defect
- Knowledge of falsity: Innocent misrepresentation is not fraud
- Intent to reduce reliance: Auditors not acting independently
- Reasonable reliance by buyer: If the buyer knows the seller is lying or exaggerating, then not fraud
- Damage to plaintiff: Must cause some kind of damage
- Nuisance: Prohibit enjoyment of plaintiff's property

## Special Problems

- Employer liability: employer and employee both liable for employee's torts when employee in the line of work (ex: delivering furniture for the furniture company)
- Joint/several liability: Sometimes, with multiple defendants, a deep-pocketed defendant could be liable for the others' responsibilities even if they only were a minor cause (some states have made laws to guard against this)

## Business Torts

### Intentional Interference with Business Relationships

Interfereing in an existing contract

- Can compete within normal means, but not over-the-top (like lying about competitor's product quality)
- *Speakers of Sport Inc, v Proserv, Inc*: Proserv offered Ivan Rodriguez big sponsorship promises to leave his conract with Speakers of Sport, which they didn't deliver; ruled to be fair competition
- *Manager's privelege*: Acting managers often sued in addition to corporation, manager is absolved if they were acting in the corporation's best interest

### Unfair Competition

Business practices based on deception

- *Lanham Act*: Outlaws" any false description or representation"; some "puffing" is allwed
- Political and innocent infringement are exempt
