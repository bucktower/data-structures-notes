**Affect**: The range of emotions and moods people experience from their life context

## Emotional Intelligence (EI)
Ability to understand emotions in ourselves and others and use that understanding to manage relationships effectively.

Four key areas: Self Awareness (recognize our emotions and their impact on us and others), Social Awareness (empathize and understand others' emotions), Self-Management (think before acting and control disruptive impulses), and Relationship Management (establish rapport with others to build good relationships)

Emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise

*Self-conscious emotions* come from internally, *social emotions* come from external sources

Emotions tend to be directed at something, more intense, and short-lasting, whereas moods are  more general vibes. Both influence and feed each other

*Emotional labor*: The need to show certain emotions in order to perform a job well. *Emotional dissonance* is when there's difference between the emotions we feel and what we try to project. *Deep acting* involves trying to modify your emotions vs. *surface acting* which is simply disguising them
