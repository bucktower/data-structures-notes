## Leader Traits and Behaviors

**Trait approaches**: Assume that leaders are endowed with certain traits or qualities associated with leader status and success; early research failed because traits are not a significant predictor of leadership or its effectiveness

- Later, more recent approaches try to identify the Big Five traits

**Behavior approach**: Trying to indtify categories of relevant leadership behavior and examining their relationships with outcomes, primarily through interviews and questionaires with subordinates

**Relations-oriented behavior**: Concern for relationships and socioemotional support

**Task-oriented behavior**: Providing direction and enforcing performance standards needed to drive production

**Contingency approaches**: Leader style or behavior is positively associated with effectiveness depends on the situation

### Contingency Model

**Directive leadership**: Provides clarity and direction for subordinates

**Supportive leadership**: Promotes friendly work climate by focusing on subordinate needs and well-being

**Achievement-oriented leadership**: Building subordinates' confidence in their ability to achieve high standards of performance through a focus on excellence and goal-setting

**Participative leadership**: Consulting with subordinates and taking their decisions into account before making decisions
