## Steps in the Decision-Making Process
Called the *rational decision model*

1. Recognize and define the problem or opportunity
    1. Why a decision is needed? What trying to accomplish?
    2. Potential pitfalls
        1. Defining to broadly or narrow
        2. Focus on symptoms instead of cause
        3. Choosing the wrong problem to deal with
4. Identify and analyze alternative courses of action
    1. Possible alternative courses of action?
    2. Identify key stakeholders, effects of each possible course of action on them
5. Choose a preferred course of action
    1. Who makes the decision? Or a combination of people?
2. Implement the preferred course of action
    1. **Lack of participation error**: Haven't included certain people in the decision-making process whose support is necessary for its implementation
2. Evaluate results and follow up as necessary
    1. Performance results are measured against initial goals, both anticipated and unanticipated outcomes are examined

## Decision to Decide
Questions on decision immediacy:
- What really matters?
    - Is this problem actually small and insignificant and taking up too much time?
- Might the problem resolve itself?
    - Ranking problems leaves less significant for last -- they'll sometimes sort themselves out
- Is this my, or our, problem?
    - Sometimes delegation is the right idea, especially if they affect someone else's work most
- Will time spent make a difference?
    - Don't waste time on impossible problems

## Ethical Reasoning
**Ethics**: Philosophical study of morality or standards regarding good character and conduct

**Moral Problem**: Poses major ethical consequences for the decisino or others

**Moral dilemma**: Need to decide between 2+ ethically uncomfortable alternatives

**Criteria questions**:

1. Utility (satisfy all stakeholders?)
2. Rights (respect the rights and duties of everyone?)
3. Justice
4. Caring

**Spotlight questions**: Expose a decision to public scrutiny and full transparency

1. "How would I feel if my family found out about this decision?"
2. "How would I feel if this decision were published in the local newspaper or posted on the internet?"
3. "What would the person you know or know who has the strongest character and best ethical judgement do in this situation?"

## Alternative Decision Environments

**Certain environments**: Information is sufficient to predict results of each alternative in advance on implementation

**Programmed decisions**: Implement solutions that have already been determined by past experience

**Uncertain environments**: Managers have so little information the cannot even assign probabilities to various alternatives and their possible outcomes

**Nonprogrammed decisions**: Specifically crafted or tailored to fit a unique situation

**Risk environments**: Probabilities regarding expected results for decision-making alternatives

## Decisions with Extreme Consequences
**Risk management**: Anticipating and factoring risks into decision making

- Strategic risks: Threats to overall business success
- Operational risks: Threats inherent in the tech used to reach business success
- Reputation risks: Threats to a brand or firm's reputation

**Crisis decision**: When an unexpected problem can lead to disaster if not resolved quickly and approppriately

Isolating yourself or to a small group (use groupthink!) is the worst thing to do in making a crisis decision

Crisis Preparedness Tips:

1. Take the time to understand what's happenning and the conditions
2. Attack the crisis as quickly as possible
3. Know when to back off and wait for a better opportunity to make progress with the crisis
4. Understand the danger of all-new territory
5. Value the skeptic. They help you see things differently
6. When things are going wrong and no one seems to care, you may have to start a crisis to get people's attention

## Decision-Making Models
**Classical Decision Model**: Manager or team act rationally and in a fully informed manner

- Problem fully defined, alternative actions known
- **Optimizing decision**

**Behavioral Decision Model**: People only act in terms of their perceptions

- *Cognitive limitations*: Limits on what we know at any given point in time
- *Bounded rationality*: Only make sense within the context of the situation
- **Satisficing decisions**: Choosing the first alternative that appears to give a satisfactory resolution of the problem

### Systematic and Intuitive Thinking
**Systematic thinking**: Approaches problems in a rational and analytical fashion

- Break big problems down into smaller ones
- More planning before action
- Usually recommended for superior decision making

**Intuitive thinking**: More flexible and spontaneous in decision making

- Deal with many aspects of a problem at once, searching for big picture
- Quickly jump from one issue to another, act on hunches from experience or spontaneous ideas
- Common under conditions of risk or uncertainty
- Good for creative solving and innovation

Good to have both

## Decision-Making Traps and Issues
**Heuristics**: simplifying strategies or "rules of thumb" used to make decisions

- Often lead to future systematic errors
- Make it easier to deal with uncertainty and limited information

**Availability heuristic**: Bases a decision on recent related events

**Representatives heuristic**: Bases a decision on similarities between the situation at hand and stereotypes of similar occurences

**Anchoring and adjustment heuristic**: Bases a decision on incremental adjustments to some initial value from historical precendent or reference point

### Decision Biases
**Confirmation error**: Tendency to seek confirmation for what is already thought to be true and not for disconfirming info

**Hindsight trap**: Decision maker overestimates degree to which could have predicted an event

**Framing error**: Looking at things from only a positive/negative view, when you should have the other/both ("spinning")

### Knowing When to Quit
**Escalating commitment**: Renewing efforts on a previously chosen course of action, even though it isn't working

How to avoid:

- Set advance limits on your involvement and commitment
- Make your own decisions, don't follow others because their prone to escalation
- Carefully determine why you are continuing a course of action
- Remind yourself of the costs of a course of action

### Knowing Who to Involve
**Individual decisions**: (Authority decisions) no involvement from others. Assumes the decision maker is an expert on the problem at hand

**Consultative decisions**: Inputs are gathered from other persons and the decision maker uses this information to arrive at a final choice

**Team decisions**: Group members work together to make the final choice

#### Vroom-Jago Model
- AI: Manager solves the problem/decision alone
- AII: Manager obtains necessary information from team members and then decides
    - Team members provide information, not alternatives
- CI: Manager involves team members individually, getting their ideas and suggestions
- CII: Manager shares problem with team members, getting their collective decision
- G: Engages team members in consensus to arrive at a final decision

## Creativity in Decision Making
**Creativity**: Unique and novel responses to problems

### Personal Creativity Drivers
Task expertise, task motivation, creativity skills

Creativity skills:

- Work with high energy
- Hold ground in face of criticism
- Accept responsibility for what happens
- Resourceful in difficult situations
- Both systematic and intuitive
- Objective (step back and question assumptions)
- Divergent thinking (outside the box)
- Convergent thinking (synthesize and find correct answers)
- Lateral thinking (look at diverse ways to solve problems)
- Transfer learning from one setting to another

Techniques for team creativity:

- Associative play: making up/telling stories, art projects, building toy models that come to mind when dealing with a problem
- Cross-pollination: switching members among teams to gain diverse insights
- Analogies and metaphors

*External support*: Making creativity a strategic point in the broader organization, giving the creative process time, top management allocating resources for creativity

Innovation spaces separated for normal workspaces for 15-20 people and very casual/comfortable
