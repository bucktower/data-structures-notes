MAN 320F

Motivation is ultimately up to yourself. Others can create an environment in which it can happen, but it's up to you

**Employee Value Proposition (EVP)**: What the organization offers the mployee in return for work contributions (*psychological contract*)

*Person-job fit*: Extent to which an individual's skills, interests, and personal characteristics match well with the requirements of a job

*Person-organization fit*: Extent to which an individual's values, interests, and behaviors are consistent with the culture of the organization

Motivation -> Performance -> Satisfaction -> Loop back (Motivation, ...)

**Intrinsic rewards**: Positively valued work outcomes received directly to the individual (we give them to ourselves) as a result of the work/task (feeling of achievement)

**Extrinsic rewards**: Positively valued work outcomes that are given to an individual or group by another person (praise, bonuses)

## Pay
Only serves as a motivator when high levels of job performance are the ways in which high pay is achieved (**performance-contingent pay**)

**Merit pay**: Ties an individual's salary or wage increase to measures of performance accomplishments

**Bonuses**: Awarded cash that doesn't effect annual salary

**Gain sharing**: Rewards employees in some proportion to productivity gains

**Profit sharing**: Rewards employees in some proportion to changes in organizational profits

**Stock options**: Employees can buy stocks at lower prices (Employee Stock Ownership Plans -- ESOPs)

**Skill-based Pay**: Rewards for acquiring and developing job-relevant skills. Not for particular job assignment. Good for eliminating the need for managers

## Performance Management Process
*Evaluation Purpose*: Let people know where their actual performance stands realative to objectives and standards

*Developmental Purpose*: Provides insights into individual strenghs and weaknesses

**Output measures**: Assess achievements in terms of actual work results

**Activity measures**: Assess inputs in terms of work efforts (often used when hard to measure output)

Tests for measures:
- **Reliability**: Provide consistent results each time they are used for the same person and situation
- **Validity**: Actually measure something of direct relevance to job performance

Common performance measurement errors: Halo error (need to separate different dimensions/areas of rating), Leniency error (don't be the easy-A), Central tendency error (don't lump everyone as about average), Recency error (don't let recency of an event overshadow previous), Personal bias error (don't be a racist, etc.)

## Performance Assessment Methods

### Ranking
- Straight up ranking from best to worst
- **Paired comparison**: Winning the most side-by-side comparisons
- **Forced distributions**: Like a rigid curve in a class (ex: must be 20% ranked 'poor')
- **Graphic rating scales**: Scores for different performance dimensions
    - **Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS)**: Links performance rankings to specific and observable job behaviors
- **Critical incident diaries**: Record actual examples of positive and negative work behaviors and results
    - Purely quantitative, debatable for not being quantitative
- **360 Review**: Feedback from jobholder's bosses, peers, subordinates, internal and external customers, and self-ratings

## Job Design
Process of specifying job tasks and work arrangements

**Scientific management**: Breaking jobs down into the smallest components to develop practices to increase efficiency

1. Develop a "science" for each job that covers rules of motion, standard tools, supportive work conditions
2. Hire workers with the right abilities
3. Train and motivate workers to do their jobs according to the science
4. Support workers by planning and assisting their work using the job science

Pros: Reduces skills required, allows for hiring low-cost labor, minimum job training, focuses expertise on repetitive tasks

Cons: Lower work quality, high rates of absenteeism and turnover, demands for higher wages for unappealing work, automation

**Job enlargement**: (*Horizontal loading*), More and different tasks, but all at the same level of responsibility and challenge

**Job rotation**: Increases task variety by periodically shifting workers among jobs involving different tasks, requires more training

**Job enrichment**: High-content jobs that involve planning and evaluating duties normally done by supervisors

Higher a job scores on the 5 core characteristics, the more it is enriched:

1. Skill variety (requires/uses different skills)
2. Task identity (completion of a whole and identifiable piece of work beginning to end)
3. Task significance (importance and meaningful contribution to organization or society)
4. Autonomy (freedom, independence, and discretion in scheduling the work and determining the procedures in carrying it out)
5. Job feedback (carrying out the work/activities provides direct and clear information to the employee on how well the job was done)

Enriched jobs will lead to positive outcomes only for those who are a good match for them. Fit:
- *Growth-need strength*: Room for growth
- *Knowledge and skill*: Capability of completion
- *Context satisfaction*: Satisfied with aspects of work setting (salary, quality of supervision, coworkers, working conditions)

## Alternative Work Schedules
**Compressed workweek**: Fulltime job completed in fewer than standard 5 days

**Flexible working hours**: Daily choice in work hours

**Job sharing**: 2+ people wplit one full-time job

*Work sharing*: Employees agree to cut back on number of hours worked to avoid layoffs

**Telecommuting**: Work done at home or from a remote location

**Part-time work**: Fail to qualify for as many benefits, easily laid off, but very flexible schedules; "gig economy"/"permanent temp economy" (*permatemp*)
