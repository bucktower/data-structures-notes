**Direction**: An individual's choice among alternative ends or goals

**Level**: The amount of effort put forth

**Persistence**: Length of time a person sticks with a path of action, even in face of difficulty

**Content theories**: Identify different needs that may motivate individual behavior

**Process theories**: Examine the thought processes that motivate individual behavior

## Motivational Theories
### Hierarchy of Needs Theory
5 levels of individual needs, where some are more important (and must be satisfied before others)

High-order Needs:
1. **Self-Actualization**: Need to fulfill oneself, to grow and use abilities to fullest and most creative extent
2. **Esteem**: Need for esteem of others: respect, prestige, recognition; and self-esteem: sense of cometence, mastery

Lower-Order Needs:
3. **Social**: Need for love, affection, sense of belongingness in one's relationship with other persons
4. **Safety**: Security, protection, and stability in personal events of day-to-day life
5. **Physiological**: Biological maintenance: food, water, sustenance

Not always rigid and step-by-step. Largely dependent on your situation (ex: collectivist societies like Mexico put more important on social needs than individualistic ones like US)

### ERG theory
Three types of needs:

1. **Existence Needs**: Desires for physiological and material well-being
2. **Relatedness Needs**: Desires for satisfying interpersonal relationships
3. **Growth Needs**: Desires for continued personal growth and development

**Frustration-regression**: People will often fallback and focus on other needs when their attempts at some need are not met (ex: complaining about wages when in reality there's just little opportunity for personal growth at work)

### Acquired Needs Theory
**Need for achievement (nAch)**: Desire to do something better or more efficiently

Workplace: Individual responsibilities, challenging goals, performance feedback

**Need for affiliation (nAff)**: Desire to establish and maintain friendly and warm relations with others

Workplace: Interpersonal relationships, opportunities for communication

**Need for power (nPower)**: Desire to control others, influence their behavior, or to be responsible for others

Workplace: Seeks influence over others and likes attention and recognition

People have different levels of each. In identifying each in yourself and others, you can then craft a more motivated workplace

Some work better in different jobs (ex: executive is likely more successful if nPower > nAff)

### Two-Factor Theory
Identifies job context as the source of job dissatisfaction and job content as the source of job satisfaction

#### Hygiene Factors
Cause of job dissatisfaction when poor. More related to the setting in which people work than the nature of the work itself

Improving hygiene factors doesn't increase job satisfaction, only decrease job dissatisfaction

- Salary
- Organizational policies
- Quality of supervision
- Working conditions
- Relationshiops with coworkers
- Status and security
- Base wage or salary

#### Motivator Factors
Presence or absence of satisfiers or motivators in people's jobs is the key to satifaction, motivation, and performance

#### Two Separate Factors
Job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction are seaparate dimensions

**Job enrichment**: Tries to build more motivator factors into job content

### Emotional Drives or Needs Model
1. **Drive to Acquire**: Obtain physical or psychological gratification
2. **Drive to Bond**: Connect with other people individually and in groups
3. **Drive to Comprehend**: Understand things and gain a sense of mastery
4. **Drive to Defend**: Protected from threats and obtain justice

60% of motivation workers experience comes from boss meeting the four drives

## Motivation and Equity
**Equity theory**: Any perceived inequity becomes a motivating state that people will work to eliminate

**Perceived inequity**: When someone belives that he or she has been under-rewarded or over-rewarded for work contributions

Individual outcomes / Individual efforts =? Others' outcomes / Others' efforts

*Felt negative inequity*: Received less than others in proportion to work efforts (under-reward inequity)

Ways of coping:
- Reduce amount of work done
- Ask for more reward
- Leave
- Change comparison point/person
- Psychologically distort things
- Try to change the efforts of the comparison person

*Felt positive inequity*: Recieved more than others in proportion to work efforts (over-reward inequity)

### Organizational Justice
How fair and equitable people view the practices and outcomes of their workplace

**Procedural justice**: Process of rules and procedures is properly followed in ALL cases

**Distributive justice**: Everyone (with all demographics/backgrounds) is treated the same

**Interactional justice**: People affected by a decision are treated with dignity and respect

**Commutative justice**: Exchanges among parties is considered free, fair, and transparent

### Expectancy
**Expectancy theory**: Motivation is the result of a rational calculation

- *Expectancy*: Probability that work effort will be followed by performance accomplishment
- *Instrumentality*: Probability of recieving rewards for performance
- *Valence*: Value attached by an individual to whatever work outcomes

`Motivation = Expectancy * Instrumentality * Valence = M = E * I * V`

### Goals
Key findings of research:
- More difficult goals are more likely to lead to higher performance
- More specific goals are more likely to lead to higher performance
- Task feedback/acknowledgement is more likely to motivate people towards higher performance by encouraging even higher performance goals
- Better feeling of self-efficacy and abilities lead to higher performance
- Goals that are accepted and committed to give higher performance

**Management By Objectives (MBO)**: Process of joint goal setting between managers or team leaders and those who report to them
1. Jointly establish goals with team leader and team member
2. Team member individually acts on goals
3. Jointly evalueate results and recycle process
