# 1.1: Systems of Linear Equations
General form for linear equations: $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b$

> **Solution set:** set of all possible solutions
> 
> Two linear systems are **equivalent** if they have the same solution set

A system of linear equations has:
1. No solution
2. Exactly one solution
3. Infinitely many solutions

> **Coefficient matrix** contains coefficients
> 
> **Augmented matrix** adds in another column for the right side of the equation
> 
> A matrix's **size** = # rows x # columns = m x n (*matrix notation*)

## Solving a Linear System
One way: Eliminate a variable by subtracting it from the first equation

### Elementary Row Operations
1. (Replacement) Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row2. (Interchange) Interchange two rows3. (Scaling) Multiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant

> **Row equivalent**: there's a sequence of elementary row operations that transform one matrix into the other

Row operations are *reversible*

Augmented matrices of two linear systems are row equivalent >> two systems have the same solution set

## Existence and Uniqueness
1. Is the system *consistent* -- does at least one solution exist (can you put it into triangular form)?
2. If it does exist, is it the only one -- is the solution *unique*?

## Possible Solutions
1. **No solution** (inconsistent)
2. **Exactly one solution** (consistent)
3. **Infinitely many solutions** (consistent)
