## Big Five Personality Traits

1. Extraversion—the degree to which someone is outgoing, sociable, and assertive. An extravert is comfortable and confident in interpersonal relationships; an intro- vert is more withdrawn and reserved.
2. Agreeableness—the degree to which someone is good-natured, cooperative, and trusting. An agreeable person gets along well with others; a disagreeable person is a source of conflict and discomfort for others.
3. Conscientiousness — the degree to which someone is responsible,dependable,and careful. A conscientious person focuses on what can be accomplished and meets commitments; a person who lacks conscientiousness is careless, often trying to do too much and failing, or doing little.
4. Emotional stability—the degree to which someone is relaxed, secure, and un- worried. A person who is emotionally stable is calm and confident; a person lacking in emotional stability is anxious, nervous, and tense.
5. Openness to experience—the degree to which someone is curious, open to new ideas, and imaginative. An open person is broad-minded, receptive to new things, and comfortable with change; a person who lacks openness is narrow-minded, has few interests, and is resistant to change.
