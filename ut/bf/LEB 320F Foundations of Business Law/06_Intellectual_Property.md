# Unit 6: Intellectual Property

LEB 320F

## Trademarks

Any distinctive word, phrase, symbol, or design adopted for the purpose of identifying the origin of goods being offered for sale

- Trademark infringement can occur even if the defendant didn't intend it
- Lanham Act is the main act to go to
- Trademark can be: generic, descriptive, suggestive, or arbitrary/fanciful (easier to trademark as you go on)
- Can be renewed every 10 years if you can prove that a good-faith attempt is made to keep using it in interstate commerce
- Intent To Use (ITUs) can reserve a trademark temporarily for 6 mos - yr
- *Genericide*: A formerly protected term becomes generic and cannot be re-protected
  - Many companies have learned from the past and greatly emphasize their brand (Kleenex, Xerox, Coke, etc)
- Anti-Dilution Statutes: Prohibit use of some marks even where goods or services are not similar and there's no likelihood of confusion, just because the mark is "famous"

### Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act

**Cybersquatter**: Someone who registers a domain name that: is easily confusing with another's protected trademark, bad faith intent to commercially exploit the trademark, likely effect is to either cause confusion or dilution (if famous)

Considerations for determining a cybersquatter in court:

1. Defendant had preexisting trademark or other intellectual property rights for the words used
2. Domain name includes the defendant's name
3. Defendant made previous use of the word or words in domain name in connection with legitimate sale of goods or services
4. Defendant making genuine noncommercial or fair use of mark at website

5. Defendant intended to divert customers away from legit one
6. Defendant previously offered to sell domain name without having made a legitimate business use of it
7. Provided false information upon registration or for contact
8. Defendant's prior conduct with domain names

Madrid Agreement: Establishes Madrid Protocol which allow for one centralized filing of a trademark application in a member country and payment of a single filing fee, and then trademark is forwarded to member countries (no translation needed)

## Trade Secrets

The extent to which a company goes to protect a secret is constantly brought to mind

Misappropriation: Divulging secrets (common when a rival company hires employees who then disclose confidential information); does NOT apply if information is within the product or the product is reverse-engineered, unless the technology is patented

*Integrated Cash Management Services v Digital Transactions, Inc*: 

- *Doctrine of inevitable disclosure*: Prevents employee who has left a company for working for another if employee's new job duties will inevitably cause the employee to rely on knowledge of former employer's trade secrets
- *Economic Espionage Act*: Makes it a federal crime to steal trade secrets

Software patents:

- Code can be copyrighted
- Software patents are a thing, but you'll have a much stronger case if you're dealing with hardware at some point, much less strong dealing with just algorithms
