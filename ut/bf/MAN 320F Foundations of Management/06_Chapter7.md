## Teams Overview
**Team**: Group of people collectively accountable for using complimentary skills to achieve a common purpose

Usually fall under one of three functions:

- Recommend things
  - Usually temporary
- Run things
  - Ex: Top management
  - Identify overall organizational purposes, goals, and values; craft strategies and persuade others
- Make or do things
  - Ongoing tasks (marketing, sales, ENGINEERING)

**Formal teams**: Created and officially designated to serve specific purposes

- Can be permanent or temporary

**Informal teams**: Emerge to serve special interests

- *Friendship groups*: People who like one another
- *Interest groups*: People who share job-related interests
- **Social network analysis**: Tool used to identify informal groups and networks by asking people to identify others who most help out, communicate with, and motivate/demotivate them

**Cross-functional team**: People from different departments brought together for horizontal integration

**Functional silos problem**: Members of functional units stay focused on internal matters and minimize interactions with other functions

**Problem-solving team**: Created temporarily to serve a specific purpose

**Employee involvement team**: Teams who members meet regularly to collectively examine workplace issues

**Quality circle**: Small team of people who meet periodically and make proposals to increase quality

**Self-managing team**: Make their own decisions needed to manage themselves, ridding need for managers; usually 5-15 members
  - *Multiskilling*: Capable of performing many different jobs

**Virtual teams** work together through computer mediation

Steps to successful virtual teams:

- Team members high in initiative and capable of self-starting
- Team members join and engage the team with positive attributes
- Team members known for working hard to meet team goals
- Begin with social messaging to allow each other to personalize the process
- Assign clear goals and roles so that everyone knows what each other are doing
- Gather regular feedback from members so they know how they think they're doing and how to improve
- Provide regular feedback to team members about team accomplishments

## Team Effectiveness
**Effective team**: One that achieves high levels of task performance, member satisfaction, and team viability

*Task performance*: Achieves its performance goals in the standard sense of quantity, quality, and timeliness of work results

*Member satisfaction*: Members believe that their participation and experiences are positive and meet personal needs

*Team viability*: Members are sufficiently satisfied to continue working together on an ongoing basis

**Synergy**: Creation of a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts

Performance advantages:

1. When there's no clear "expert" for a particular problem, teams make better judgements
2. Problems are complex and require a division of labor and the sharing of information
3. Teams tend to make riskier decisions, teams can be more creative and innovative

**Social faciliatation**: Tendency of one's behavior to be influenced by the presence of others in a group or social setting

- Positive when the skill is known well
- Negative when the skill is not

**Social loafing**: People work less hard in groups than they would individually

- Keep group size small
- Give free-riders specific roles so they're highlighted with peer pressure to perform
- Avoid personality conflicts
- Avoid ambiguous agendas and bad organization

## Stages of Team Development

- **Forming stage**: Primary concern is initial entry of members into the group
- **Storming stage**: Membership expectations clarified; high emotionality and tension among group members
- **Norming stage**: Members really come together as a coordinated unit; premature sense of accomplishment
- **Performing stage**: Emergence of mature, organized, well-functioning team
- **Adjourning stage**: Leave, often to reconvene later, important long-term test of team success

## Input Foundations for Teamwork
`Team effectiveness = Quality of inputs * (Process gains - Process losses)`

Setting and office architecture can play a part

When teams succeed with complex tasks, members tend to experience high satisfaction

- *Technical demands*: Degree to which it is routine or not, level of difficulty involved, information requirements
- *Social demands*: Degree to which issues of interpersonal relationships, egos, controversies, come into play

### Team Size
Amazon: No team should be larger than two pizzas can feed

Odd-numbered help rule out tie votes, move quick

Even-numbered put more emphasis on consensus, rather than just override

**Team composition**: Mix of abilities, skills, personalities, and experiences that team members bring

**FIRO-B Theory**: Teams whose members have compatible needs will work better together

**Status congruence**: Person's position in a team is equivalent in status to positions the individual holds outside

*Homogeneous teams* with similar backgrounds are often more harmonious, but can underperform

*Heterogeneous teams* can get a lot more done IF they can settle their differences

**Diversity-consensus dilemma**: Tendency for diversity in groups to create process difficulties even though it offers improved potential for problem solving

**Collective intelligence**: Ability of a team to perform well across a range of tasks. Closely tied to social sensitivities and the absence of conversational domination by a few members
