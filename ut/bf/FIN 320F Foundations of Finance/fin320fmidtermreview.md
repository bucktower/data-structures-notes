# Unit 1

- People's actions are guided by positive and negative **incentives**: prestige, self-worth, legal sanctions, loss of money, social sanctions, physical sanctions, wealth, family
- People try to imperfectly maximize using limited resources: time, wealth; limited resources, information, knowledge, intellect, decision making by leaders and experts

**Confirmation bias**: Seeking out facts that reinforce what you already believe

# Unit 2

**Non-governmental organization (NGO)**: Private sector, voluntary (usually non-profit and non-sectarian) organization that contributes/volunteers/cooperates on humanitarian, progressive, education, etc causes

**Opportunism**: Market participants seek to benefit themselves by unethical behavior; Adam Smith believed it is bad and reduces efficiency and fairness (good moral competition is the goal)

Three key roles of government:

1. Enhance the welfare of its citizens
2. Limit opportunistic behavior
3. Modify or replace markets (in some instances)

*Mixed economies*: Elements of both market and command economies

**Monetary policy**: Primarily concerned with the management of interest rates, supply of money in circulation; Federal Reserve

**Fiscal policy**: Taxing and spending
