MAN 320F

**Vertical specialization**: An organization's hierarchical division of labor

**Organization charts**: Depict formal structures of organizations

**Span of control**: Number of individuals reporting to a supervisor

Line units (managament/administration) vs. Staff units (technical)

### Controls

Set of mechanisms to keep action or outputs within predetermined limits

**Output controls**: Certain output expected, method of getting there left up to lower management

**Process controls**: Specify manner in which tasks are accomplished

- Policy (broad guideline) vs Procedure (best method for performing a task)

**Formalization**: Written documentation of rules, procedures, and policies to help standardize

## Organizing and Coordinating Work

**Horizontal specialization**: Organizing specific work units or groups within an organization

**Functional departmentation**: Groups individuals by skill, knowledge, and action

**Divisional departmentation**: Grouping by products, territories, services, clients, or legal entities

**Matrix departmentation**: Uses both

### Coordination

Personal methods: direct contact, committees

Impersonal: stress consistency and standardization

## Organizational Design

Process of choosing and implementing a structural configuration

**Simple design**: One or two ways of specializing individuals and units

**Operations technology**: Combination of resources, knowledge, and techniques that create a product or service output for an organization

### Thompson's View of Technology

**Intensive technology**: Uncertainty how to produce desired outcome; specialists must be brought together (ex: hospital operating room)

**Mediating technology**: Links parties that want to become interdependent (ex: bank links creditors and depositors)

**Long-linked technology**: Mass production/assembly; steps to produce desired outcome is broken down into steps. Control is critical; coordination focused on making sequential steps work together

### Joan Woodward's View of Technology

- *Small batch production*: Small batches of tailor-made products
- *Mass production*: Mass production of a few different types of items
- *Continuous-process technology*: A few products using considerable automation (ex: chemical plants, oil refineries)

### Environment and Organizational Design

**General environment**: Set of cultural, economic, legal-political, and educational conditions found in which an organization operates

**Specific environment**: Set of owners, suppliers, distributors, government agencies, and competitors with which an organization must interact with to survive

**Environmental complexity**: Magnitude of problems and opportunities in an organization's environment (degree of richness, interdependence, uncertainty stemming from general and specific environment)

- Richness: More wealth creation, education, general prosperity (customers willing to spend, investors willing to invest)
- Interdependence: Involving powerful outsiders, creating a centralized staff dept to handle an important external group (like the govt)
- Uncertainty and volatility: Need to change organizational design (usually more flexibility needed) to deal with uncertainty and volatility

## Bureaucracy and Beyond

Management of networks and development of alliances are two keys for succeeding in complex global economy

**Interfirm alliance**: Join venture between two independent firms

**Bureaucracies**: Rely on a division of labor, hierarchal control, promotion by merit, career opportunities for employees, administration by rule

**Mechanistic/Machine bureaucracy**: Vertical specialization and control (rules, policies, procedures)

**Organic/Professional bureaucracy**: Horizontal specialization (judgement of experts, personal means of coordination)

Hybrid types:

- Multiple divisions, where each can choose some place between mechanistic vs organic bureaucracy
- **Conglomerate**: Single corporation contains a number of unrelated businesses; various businesses are unrelated
