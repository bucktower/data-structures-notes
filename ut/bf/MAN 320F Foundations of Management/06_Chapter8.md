## Characteristics of High-Performance Teams
Turn a general sense of purpose into specific performance objectives

Collective iqntelligence helps fuel repeat successes

Right mix of skills: technical, problem-solving, and interpersonal

**Team building**: Ocassional need for a performance "tune up" (even the best teams have slumps); sequence of planned activities designed to gather and analyze data on the functioning of a team and to initiate changes designed to improve teamwork and effectiveness

*Formal retreat*: An actual getaway to an off-site retreat

*Continuous improvement approach*: Manager, team leader, or group members themselves take responsibility for regularly engaging in the team-building process (as simple as periodic meetings)

**Team or group dynamics**: Forces that effect the way members relate to and work with one another

## Improving Team Processes
**Tough battler**: Frustated by lack of identity within a new group

- Act aggresively
- Reject authority
- Best response: let the new member share their skills and interests, and discuss how they can be best used in the team

**Friendly helper**: Insecure, uncertainties of intimacy and control

- Show extradordinary support for others
- Seek alliances in subgroups or cliques
- Best reponse: Offer support and encouragement, encourage confidence in joining in

**Objective thinker**: Anxious about how personal needs will be met in the group

- Passive, reflective, single-minded manner
- Best response: Discuss team goals and expectations, clarify member roles in meeting them

**Role**: Set of expectations with a job or position on a team

**Role ambiguity**: Person is uncertain about his or her role on a team

**Role overload**: Too much is expected and someone feels overwhelmed

**Role underload**: Too little is expected and the individual feels underused

**Role conflict**: When a person is unable to mee the expectations of others

- Intrasender role conflict (one person gives conflicting expectations)
- Intersender role conflict (different people give conflicting and mutually exclusive expectations)
- Person-role conflict (person's values come into conflict with role expectations)
- Inter-role conflict (2+ roles held by person come into conflict, including non-work roles)

**Role negotiation**: Process for discussing and agreeing on what team members expect of one another

**Distributed leadership**: Shares responsibility among team members for meeting team task and maintenance needs

**Task activities**: What team members and leaders do that directly contributes to the performance of important tasks

**Maintenance activities**: Activities conducted to help keep a team intact and healthy

**Disruptive behaviors**: Activities that hurt the group process (bullying, overly aggressive, disrespect, withdrawing)

**Norms**: Rules or standards for the behavior of group members

**Performance norms**: Sets expectations for how hard members work and what the team should accomplish

Common team norms:

- Ethics norms
- Organizational and personal pride norms
- High-achievement norms
- Support and helpfulness norms
- Improvement and change norms

How to influence team norms:

- Act as a positive role model (be exemplar of the norm)
- Discuss team goals and norms (earlier confronted the better)
- Hold regular meetings to discuss team performance

### Cohesiveness
Degree to which team members are attracted to it and motivated to remain a part of it

**Rule of conformity**: Greater the cohesiveness, greater conformity of members to team norms

Higher team cohesiveness

- Homogeneous teams
- Smaller teams
- Members respect each other's competencies
- Agree on common goals
- Like to work together rather than alone on team tasks
- Rise when groups are physically isolated from others
- Rise when performance success or crisis

**Inter-team dynamics**: Occur as groups cooperate and compete with one another (between groups)

Too much competitiveness can be a bad thing:

- Focus on a common enemy
- Focus on a common goal

## Improving Team Communications

### Interaction Patterns
1. Interacting team (**decentralized communication network**, everyone equally communicating with everyone else)
2. Co-acting team (**centralized communication network** -- revolves around one person)
3. Counteracting team (restricted communicating network, disagreement between factions)
    1. Can sometimes help to stimulate creativity and double check decisions

**Proxemics**: Use of space as people interact (open office buildings, etc)

**Virtual communication networks**: Link team members through electronic communication

## Improving Team Decisions
**Decision making**: The process of choosing among alternative courses of action

**Lack of Response**: Decisions are made after one idea after another is suggested and all are ignored, to where left with one

- Common with low-performance and low-confidence teams
- Easy for a team to move off in the wrong

**Authority Rule**: Manager makes the decision

- Effectiveness determined by whether group accepts it and whether manager had all necessary information

**Minority Rule**: 2-3 people dominate the decision making process, often by rushing it

- Team commitment to decision is usually low

**Majority Rule**: Obvious. Does create some drawbacks by creating coalitions with "winners" and "losers" and lingering resentments

**Consensus**: One alternative is favored by most team members and other team members agree to support it

- Those who may have opposed it have been listened to
- Inefficient from a time perspective, but useful for commitment

**Unanimity**: Everyone agrees

Best groups alternate between different ones for different circumstances

**Groupthink**: Team members are so focused on cohesion that they're unwilling to criticize each other

**Brainstorming**: Generating ideas through freewheeling and without criticism

- "Solo" thinking beforehand
- Keep groups small
- Rules are clear and followed

Rules:

1. No criticism, no judging
2. Freewheeling is welcome. The crazier the better
3. Quantity is the goal
4. Piggybacking is welcome

**Nominal group technique**: Structured rules for generating and prioritizing ideas

1. Everyone responds in writing to some *nominal question* focused on bringing out ideas for improvement (quantity is the goal)
2. Everyone reads their response. No criticism is allowed, only questions for clarification so that everyone understands
3. Vote on responses

**Delphi technique**: Generate decision-making alternatives through a series of survey questionaires that are collected, some are selected by a moderator, who then asks additional followup questions on them
