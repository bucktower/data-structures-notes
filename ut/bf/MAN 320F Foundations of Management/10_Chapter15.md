**Organizational culture**: System of shared actions, values, and beliefs that develops within an organization and guides behavior of members

**Corporate culture**: Organizational culture in business setting

**External adaptation**: Ways of reaching goals, tasks to be completed, methods used to achieve goals, coping with success and failure

**Internal integration**: Collective identity of members and how they live and work together

*Subculture*: Groups of individuals who exhibit a unique pattern of values and philosophies that is consistent with the organization's dominant values and philosophy

*Countercultures*: Groups whose patterns of values and philosophies reject those of the larger organization or social system

Managers can choose to accept societal divisions (which can lead to challenges) or work to block them from entereing the fabric of the organization by creating a **multicultural organization** (values diversity, but works to block transfer of societally based subcultures into the fabric of the organization)

## Understanding Organizational Cultures

**Observable culture**: "The way we do things around here"

**Saga** (embellished heroic account of accomplishments) of the founding and the founder are useful to help guide organizational vision

**Rites**: Standardized and recurring activities at special times to influence behaviors and understanding of organizational members; **rituals** are systems of rites

*Cultural symbol*: Object, act, or event that serves to transmit cultural meaning (like unique uniforms)

Shared values create a strong corporate culture; shared meanings unite perspectives; strong corporate culture can be hard to change if it ever needs to be

**Organizational myth**: Commonly-held cause-effect relationship or assertion within an organization that cannot be supported empirically

**Management philosophy**: Links key goal-related issues with key collaboration issues to come up with general ways in which the firm will manage its affairs (establish boundaries, a consistent way to approach new situations, bond employees by ensuring a path to success)

Trying to top-down get people to conform to a single subculture might be bad because it eliminates diversity, which makes the organization more vulnerable to external change

**Societal goals**: An organization's intended contributions to broader society

**Output goals**: Define the type of business the organization is in

**Mission statement**: Written statement of organizational purpose

**Systems goals**: Conditions within the organization that are expected to increase the organization's survival potential

A loss of ethical standards can do much more expensive damage to a brand than just the fines levied

2 main approaches to creating better Reward Systems:

1. Fraternal, long-term commitment, peer-pressure to perform, managers are mentors
2. Evolution and change; short-term performance, managers are resource allocators

## Innovation in Organizations

**Innovation**: Process of creating new ideas and putting them into practice

1. Idea creation
2. Initial experimentation
3. Feasibility determination (Practicality/financial viability)
4. Final application (Commercialization for sale)

Important for innovative success: Vision, support for innovation, task orientation, cohesion, internal communications, external communications

**Product innovations**: Introduce new goods or services to better meet customer needs

**Process innovations**: Introduce new and better ways of doing things

**Exploitation**: Refinement and reuse of existing products and processes

**Exploration**: Stress freedom and radical thinking. Opens firm up for big changes

Managers must balance exploitation and exploration: traditionally through an R&D dept and a general one, but increasingly just making the entire organization ambidextrous

### Managing Tensions between Cultural Stability and Innovation

**Organizational cultural lag**: Condition in which dominant cultural patterns are inconsistent with new emerging innovations

Common myths:

1. Senior management has *no risk bias*: everyone has some kind of bias
2. *Presumption of administrative competence*: there is always room for significant improvement
3. *Denial of tradeoffs*: every decision is likely to anger someone
