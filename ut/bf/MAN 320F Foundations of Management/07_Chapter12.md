MAN 320F

**Power**: Ability of a person to influence or control some aspect of another person or group

**Social power**: Power that comes from the ability to influence a social relation

**Force**: Power made operative against another's will

Reducing dependence on others and increasing others' dependence on us gives us power

Problem in organizations is not power, but powerlessness -- we need to gain and use power responsibly, and expand the power of others rather than restrict it to a few

**Empowerment**: Sharing power, information, and rewards with employees to make decisions and solve problems in their work

- Results in a much more dedicated work force

**Zero-sum game**: One person's gain is equal to another person's loss

- **Iron Law of Responsibility**: When power imbalances get bad enough, forces are triggered that will rise up and take the power away (to restore power balances)
- **Psychological reactance theory**: People rebel against constraints and efforts to control their behavior
- Less focus on power *over* others, more focus on power *with* others

## Sources of Power and Influence

**Position power**: Stems from formal hierarchy or authority from a particular role

1. **Legitimate power**: Formal hierarchical authority that comes with a position
    1. If this is your only source of power, you won't be effective for long
    2. **Zone of indifference**: Range of requests that the subordinate is willing to submit to without subjecting the directives to critical evaluation or judgement
    3. **Hierarchical thinking**: Systems create positions of superiority and inferiority in organizations, can lead to less active employees
2. **Reward power**: One's ability to administer positive rewards and remove or decrease negative rewards
3. **Coercive power**: Punishment if they fail to conform to the influence attempt

**Personal power**: Resides in the individual, generated in relationships

1. **Expert power**: Having special skills and abilities that others need but do not possess themselves
    1. Not as powerful once someone more skilled shows up (ex: a master chef enters the kitchen)
2. **Referent power**: Ability to alter another's behavior because of their desire to identify with the power source
    1. Must maintain image

- When someone with personal power leaves a situation, a vacuum ensues, whereas with position power, a new replacement comes in (ex: a new US president starts to receive the intelligence briefings and as such the power through information that the previous had)

**Information power**: Possession of or access to information that is valuable to others

**Connection power**: Ability to call on connections and networks both inside and outside the organization for support in getting things done and in meeting one's goals

- **Association power**: Influence with a powerful person on whom others depend; knowing higher ups
- **Reciprocal alliances**: Form of power arising from connections with others developed through reciprocity (if one person does something, it invokes an obligation to return the favor)

## Reponses to Power and Influence

If individuals do not defer to your influence attempt, you do not have power

Three levels of conformity:

1. **Compliance**: Accept another's influence because of positive or negative outcomes tied to it (because they have to)
2. **Commitment**: Accept an influence attempt out of duty or obligation (agree with desired action, show initiative & persistence)
    1. **Identification**: Accept an influence attempt because they want to maintain a positive relationship with the person or group making the influence request
    2. **Internalization**: Follow because the induced behavior goes along with the values you truly believe in

Resistance:

1. **Constructive resistance**: Thoughtful dissent aimed at constructively challenging the manager to rethink the issue
2. **Dysfunctional resistance**: Ignoring or dismissing the request of the influencing agent

**Bathsheba syndrome**: People at the pinnacle of power with strong integrity and intelligence engage in unethical and selfish behavior because they mistakenly believe they are above the law

Avoid Bathsheba, prepare yourself for success:

- Maintain humility
- Be around others who will push back on you
- Take responsibility in the face of others' power (acting to keep power in check)

## Understanding Organizational Politics

**Organizational Politics**: Efforts by organizational members to seek resources and achieve desired goals through informal systems and structures

**Political climate**: Shared perceptions about the political nature of the organization

**Workarounds**: People go around rules to accomplish a task or goal because normal process or method isn't producing desired result

## Navigating the Political Landscape

**Power bases**: Sources of power individuals and subunits develop in organizations

**Non-substitutability**:  Individual or work performed by the subunit cannot be easily replaced (builds power)

Can also build power through developing information and connection power (building relationships and networks)

**Political savvy**: Skill at reading political environments and understanding how to influence effectively in them

**Political skill**: Ability to understand and influence others to act in ways that enhance personal or organizational objectives

**Social capital**: Current or potential resources gained through one's network

**Human capital**: Knowledge, skills, and intellectual assets employees bring to the workplace

Weak "acquaintance" ties work better than strong "friendship" ties. Individuals have more and different job opportunities when relying on weak ties

- Strong ties also require more to maintain

**Broker**: Links between structural holes in a network, providing greater access to resources, information, and opportunities

**Structural holes**: Gaps between individuals and groups in a social network
