# FIN 320F Midterm Review

# Unit 1: Human Nature and Economic Activity

- People's actions are guided by positive and negative **incentives**: prestige, self-worth, legal sanctions, loss of money, social sanctions, physical sanctions, wealth, family
- People try to imperfectly maximize using limited resources: time, wealth; limited resources, information, knowledge, intellect, decision making by leaders and experts

**Confirmation bias**: Seeking out facts that reinforce what you already believe

# Unit 2: Human Nature and the Ethics of Decision Making

**Non-governmental organization (NGO)**: Private sector, voluntary (usually non-profit and non-sectarian) organization that contributes/volunteers/cooperates on humanitarian, progressive, education, etc causes

**Opportunism**: Market participants seek to benefit themselves by unethical behavior; Adam Smith believed it is bad and reduces efficiency and fairness (good moral competition is the goal)

Three key roles of government:

1. Enhance the welfare of its citizens
2. Limit opportunistic behavior
3. Modify or replace markets (in some instances)

*Mixed economies*: Elements of both market and command economies

**Monetary policy**: Primarily concerned with the management of interest rates, supply of money in circulation; Federal Reserve

**Fiscal policy**: Taxing and spending

# Unit 3: Structuring the Business Firm

## Organization of Businesses

**Efficiency**: Squeezing the max output from limited resources

### Proprietorship

- Owned by a single person
- Easy to create
- Business IS the person (dies with that person)
  - Personally liable for company debts

### Partnership

- Partners are collectively the business
- Can be structured in a way that death or partners leaving doesn't spell the end of a partnership
- Partners are jointly liable

### Corporation

- A person before the law separate from its owners
- Separation of ownership and management
- Limited liability, unlimited life

### Other types

MLPs, REITs, LLCs are all upcoming and popular because they allow a *pass-through provision* for income

### Goals of the Corporation

- Capital budgeting decision: What productive assets should the firm obtain?
- Capital structure decision: How do we raise capital to afford those productive assets?
- Net working capital decision: How to manage short-term expenses?

**Fiduciary**: Someone who has a legal obligation to act in the interests of another

**Stakeholder**: Anyone with a stake in the corporation *other than the shareholders* (workers, suppliers, customers, governments, communities, etc)

- Shareholders have a **residual claim** on profits; only paid *after* all stakeholders have been paid

## Corporate Goals and Governance

**Corporate governance**: Structure and procedures that allow the shareholders to control the managers of the coporation to work in the shareholders' interest

- Creates an **agency relationship**, where managers are **agents** hired to run a coporation on behalf of the shareholders, who are the **principals**
- Can lead to *agency conflict* when misaligned goals, which lead to *agency costs*
- Can try to avoid using *agency control devices*
  - External control devices: Placed on managers by individuals/orgs outside of the corp (ex: govts, takeover, and courts)
  - Internal control devices: Created and run by the firm's managers and owners (ex: board of directors, by-laws)

*Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)*

# Unit 4: Accounting Value

## Developing a Company's Balance Sheets

Accounting's purposes: record performance, establish value, report to stockholders, stakeholders, and government

### GAAP

**Accrual Method/Matching Principle**: Match expenses with revenues

**Realization Principle**: Recognize revenue when a contractual obligation occurs (despite future uncertainty)

- Major cause for difference between accounting revnue and cash flow

**Cost Principle**: Record purchase price of an asset with *no adjustments* in price to reflect changes in market value

### The Balance Sheet

`Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder Equity` (*Accounting Identity*)

Assets: *current/short-term* (expected to turn into cash within a year), *long-term* (tangible like factories and vehicles and nontangible like patents and copyrights)

Claims on assets: *current/short-term* (must be paid within a year), *long-term* (often bonds)

Shareholder equity: Residual holders of the company (get what is left over)

- Preferred stock gets claims before common stock

`Net Working Capital (NWC) = Short-term assets - Short term liabilities`

## The Income Statement

Major decisions a manager must make: product decision (what do we sell?), production decision (which productive assets will we obtain?), financing decision (how will obtain the productive assets?)

**Performance**: How well the managers used assets and claims to produce "income"

Variable costs vs. fixed costs

*Net Profit Before Taxes* (NPBT records profit after all business expenses, both production and financing have been subtracted from revenues)

*Net Income* = `NPBT - Tax`

*Depreciation*: An application of the matching principle where accountant allocates the cost/purchase price of an asset over each year it's used

*Average Tax Rate* (average tax you pay on total income) vs. *Marginal Tax Rate* (how much more tax you would pay on earning another dollar)

**Net income (GAAP) is DIFFERENT from Cash Flow (`Cash received - Cash paid out`)**

# Unit 5: Economic Value

## Calculating Economic Value

**Economic asset**: Entities functioning as a store of value

**Economic value**: Max dollar price someone will pay for an economic asset

- Opportunity cost (best alternative that is not chosen)
- Cash flow (purchasing power, including borrowing)
- Time value of money (*present value* vs *future value*)
- Risk

**Economic decision making**: Calculating economic value and comparing to the cost of obtaining the asset

**Creating wealth**: When price paid for an economic asset is less than its economic value

**First Principle of Finance**: A dollar received today is worht more than a dollar received in the future

## Making Wealth-Increasing Decisions

**Decision rule**: Quantitative rule that evaluates whether a course of action should be undertaken

Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

`IRR = (Ending value - Beginning value) / Beginning value`

**Net Present Value**: Decision-making process using time-value and opportunity cost to compare a decision with its costs

`NPV = PV (inflows) - PV (outflows)`

- If positive, you should accept the project, otherwise reject
