## Leader Traits and Behaviors

**Trait approaches**: Assume that leaders are endowed with certain traits or qualities associated with leader status and success; early research failed because traits are not a significant predictor of leadership or its effectiveness

- Later, more recent approaches try to identify the Big Five traits

**Behavior approach**: Trying to indtify categories of relevant leadership behavior and examining their relationships with outcomes, primarily through interviews and questionaires with subordinates

**Relations-oriented behavior**: Concern for relationships and socioemotional support

**Task-oriented behavior**: Providing direction and enforcing performance standards needed to drive production

**Contingency approaches**: Leader style or behavior is positively associated with effectiveness depends on the situation

### Contingency Model

Indicates whether a manager's leadership behavior or style (independent variable) is related to leadership effectiveness (outcome/dependent variable) through the situation (moderator variable)

**Directive leadership**: Provides clarity and direction for subordinates

**Supportive leadership**: Promotes friendly work climate by focusing on subordinate needs and well-being

**Achievement-oriented leadership**: Building subordinates' confidence in their ability to achieve high standards of performance through a focus on excellence and goal-setting

**Participative leadership**: Consulting with subordinates and taking their decisions into account before making decisions

**Leader-match**: A leader's style does not change:

- Pick the right leader for the situation
- Change the situation to fit the leader

## Charismatic/Transformational Views

**Charisma**: A special personal quality or attractiveness that enables an individual to influence others

**Personalized charismatics**: Focus on power for personal rather than collective benefits 

**Power distance**: Extent to which followers see leaders as having much higher status than them

- Leaders can reduce power distance to reduce disappointment when followers realize that charismatic leaders are human and have faults
