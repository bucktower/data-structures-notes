# Data Structures Notes
These are just some notes that I make to myself, going through interview resources:

- Cracking the Coding Interview
- Leetcode
- Hackerrank
- Firecode

I'll probably rename this something other than "data structures" because interviews can go over a ton of stuff.

## Time Complexity
### Big O
These are the most common time complexities:

O(1) > O(log(N)) > O(N) > O(N log(N)) > O(N<sup>2</sup>) > O(2<sup>N</sup>)

Big O represents the **worst case**/slowest on runtime.

**Expected case** is what we expect on any given run. For most algorithms, it's the same as the worst case.

### Big Omega Ω
Big Ω represents the **best case**/fastest for runtime.

### Big Theta Θ
Only for programs that are the same for Big O and Big Ω. So if a program has O(N) and Ω(N)

## Space Complexity
Similar principles of Big O, Big Ω, and Big Θ from above
