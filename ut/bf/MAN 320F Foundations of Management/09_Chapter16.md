MAN 320F

**Vertical specialization**: An organization's hierarchical division of labor

**Organization charts**: Depict formal structures of organizations

**Span of control**: Number of individuals reporting to a supervisor

Line units (managament/administration) vs. Staff units (technical)

### Controls

Set of mechanisms to keep action or outputs within predetermined limits

**Output controls**: Certain output expected, method of getting there left up to lower management

**Process controls**: Specify manner in which tasks are accomplished

- Policy (broad guideline) vs Procedure (best method for performing a task)

**Formalization**: Written documentation of rules, procedures, and policies to help standardize

## Organizing and Coordinating Work

**Horizontal specialization**: Organizing specific work units or groups within an organization

**Functional departmentation**: Groups individuals by skill, knowledge, and action

**Divisional departmentation**: Grouping by products, territories, services, clients, or legal entities

**Matrix departmentation**: Uses both

### Coordination

Personal methods: direct contact, committees

Impersonal: stress consistency and standardization

## Organizational Design

Process of choosing and implementing a structural configuration

**Simple design**: One or two ways of specializing individuals and units

**Operations technology**: Combination of resources, knowledge, and techniques that create a product or service output for an organization

### Thompson's View of Technology

**Intensive technology**: Uncertainty how to produce desired outcome; specialists must be brought together (ex: hospital operating room)

**Mediating technology**: Links parties that want to become interdependent (ex: bank links creditors and depositors)

**Long-linked technology**: Mass production/assembly; steps to produce desired outcome is broken down into steps. Control is critical; coordination focused on making sequential steps work together

### Joan Woodward's View of Technology

- *Small batch production*: Small batches of tailor-made products
- *Mass production*: Mass production of a few different types of items
- *Continuous-process technology*: A few products using considerable automation (ex: chemical plants, oil refineries)
