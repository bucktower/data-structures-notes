# Taxonomy of Applications

* Headers will tell you how you got from the Application Layer
    * Useful for getting back there on receieving end? Also for returning to a specific device?
* 2 Types of applications: Client-Server (vast majority), and Client-Client (BitTorrent, etc)
* **connless**: connection-less; no talking between client & server, msg is simply sent and a reply is processed

TCP requires a connection; UDP is connless
