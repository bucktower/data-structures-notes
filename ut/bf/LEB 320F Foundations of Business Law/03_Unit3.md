# Unit 3

LEB 320F

## Authority of Federal and State Governments

- State governments can delegate any powers to local governments (such as zoning)
- *Gonzales v Raich*: Federal government does have the ability to regulate homegrown weed bc of its potential effect on the interstate weed market (similar to Wickard's wheat), even though that market is illegal
- Obamacare treated as a tax, but federal government cannot penalize people for doing nothing

Principles that limit the power of the states to regulate commerce:

1. Preemption
  - *Federal Preemption*: Direct conflict btwn state and federal law
  - *Express Preemption*: **Supremacy clause** (federal is "supreme law of the land"); federal government can preempt state laws that deal with expressly-federal powers (like patents) if they want to (usually don't care)
  - *Implied preemption*: Someone tries to prove that federal statue *intended* to govern the same area as some state one
    - Must prove federal regulation is *comprehensive* (Congress tried to create a relatively complete regulatory structure to address the problem)
    - Must prove there's a very strong need for a uniform national regulatory policy in whatever area
  - *Direct Conflict*: Just being more stringent (ex: California's more strict emission limits on cars) doesn't mean direct conflict with federal law
2. Discrimination against interstate commerce
  - States cannot shelter their own corporations from other states' or nations' (although federal govt can)
  - Cannot give favorable treatment to local state businesses in access for state resources
3. Unduly burdening interstate commerce
  - Weighing state's economic interests vs federal ones
  - Taxes must
    1. Only applied to property/activities that have a substantianal nexus/connection to taxing jurisdiction
    2. Reasonable related to services provided by taxing jurisdiction
    3. "Apportioned" so that item is not subject to multiple taxation in the various places it's used/located
  - *Grandholm v Heald*: NY and MI laws discriminated against out-of-state direct-to-consumer wineries stuck down
  - States must respect rulings from other state (**Full Faith and Credit Clause**) unless original ruling didn't have jurisdiction, or the state has specific laws that invalidate the situation
  - **Contract Clause**: No state shall pass a law that impairs the obligation of contracts

## Protecting Basic Rights

- *Doctrine of incorporation*: Concept of due process from 14th amendment gives many other rights
- **Privileges and Immunities Clause**: Prohibit states of discriminating against residents of other states for "fundamental" privileges and immunities
- Freedom of speech includes the freedom to not say something you don't want to & corporate freedom of speech
- *Sorrell v IMS Health, Inc*: Vermont banned selling doctor/"prescriber" information for purposes of sales to medical co.s struck down bc marketing speech is protected
- *Rational basis test*: Did the statute make an honest effort at solving a problem in a rational way?
- **Substantive Due Process**: Prohibits statutes and regulations that are arbitrary and irrational
  - Not used as much anymore
- **Procedural Due Process**: Fair procedures must be followed
- **Takings Clause**: Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation (eminent domain)
  - Can include partially taking value (such as flying planes low over adjacent property for runway)
  - *Kelo v City of New London*: Economic revitalization is a reasonable cause for eminent domain

## Criminal Law

- **Guilty act**: Any action that even is part of a step to commit a crime
  - Failure to perform legally-imposed duty: *actus reus*
- **Guilty mind**: Intent to do wrong (*mens rea*)
- Defenses negating intent: infancy, insanity, intoxication, mistake; entrapment, self-defense, defense of others

## Federal Crimes Affecting Business

Biggest ones:

- Mail and Wire Fraud
- Travel Act (traveling or using interstate commerce to commit illegal action)
- Hobbs Act (obstructing, delays, or affects commerce or its movement by robbery or extortion)
- Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO): Civil and criminal penalties for racketeering

### Insider Trading

Government must establish that the defendant:

1. Bought/sold securities
2. With scienter (intent)
3. On the basis of
4. Info that was both material and nonpublic
5. While owing a duty to disclose or abstain

- *United States v Anderson*: Insider trading selloff by CEO before releasing disappointing quarterly sales numbers announcement
- People who owe a duty to disclose or abstain, temporary insiders, misappropriators/outsider trading, tippees
- Corporations can be held liable for the actions of employees
