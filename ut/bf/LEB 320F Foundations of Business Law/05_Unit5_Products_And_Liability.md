# Unit 5

LEB 320F

## Scope of Article 2 of the UCC

### Goods

Must be tangible and movable

- Real estate is not a good, but property tied to it that is sold is a good so long as it is removed as a part of the process and its removal does not cause material harm to the real estate
- Unborn animals, money treated as a commodity, products specially manufactured for buyers are all goods
- In determining good vs. service, courts try and gauge the primary intent of the buyer
- Food sold in restaurants are goods
- *Rottner v AVG Technologies USA*: Free software download to speed up computer ended up reformatting hard drive; AVG Technologies argued it was a service, not a good and motioned to dismiss -- denied because the way the software was offered via trial and sale was more of a good than a service

### Merchants

- Not just retailers, but also wholesalers and manufacturers -- anyone who "deals in goods of the kind"; only for their specific industries
- End consumer if they're going to use building materials to offer a service like constructing a house (building contractor) is a merchant
- Employing a merchant on your behalf/broker makes you a merchant
- *Brooks Cotton Co v Williams*: Williams (a cotton farmer) failed to deliver on a verbal contract with Brooks Cotton Co, enforceable only if both parties are merchants; farmers sell crops, therefore they are merchants

### Leases

- Many of the laws for goods waterfall into leases
- Article 2A extends upon Article 2 of UCC (the one for goods) with special conditions for leases
  - Distinguishes between a true lease (bailment law) and lease intended as security for a loan
- If the lessor (offering the lease) breaches the lease, lessee has the right to cancel the lease and recover to the extent "just under the circumstances"
- If the lessee (consuming the lease) breaches the lease, lessor may cancel, repossess, and pursue damages; lessor not entitled to double profits from re-leasing property
- Finance lessors (those who don't select, manufacture, or supply goods out of inventory, but serve as a financial conduit) are automatically expempted from implied warranties
- *Consumer lease*: Usually dealing with lessee's personal, family, or household purpose; lessor must pay attorney fees if there's something wrong with their agreement

## Basic Principles of Sales Contracts

- Contract only exists if both parties clearly intended it to
  - If certain important details are ommitted (such as place for delivery, price, etc), UCC has some defaults
- Contract exists if the intent is there, even if not all the details are there
  - Illegal to "surprise" parties with fine print
- Contracts >$500 must be in writing to be enforceable unless: seller already substantially began producing specially made goods, payment has been made/accepted goods retrieved, confirmatory memorandum between parties, plaintiff admitted there was an oral agreement
- A party with much superior bargaining power cannot essentially strip the value of the good off from the other party
- Courts also consider (in decreasing importance): previous course of performance within contract, past contracts between parties, usage of the trade established and others in the industry
- "Good faith" is part of contracts

## CISG (UN's Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods)

- The default laws between companies from different nations who have adopted the CISG, unless overriden within the contract
- Written evidence not needed so long as evidence prove existence and terms of contract
- Additional terms upon acceptance is viewed as a counteroffer
- "Firm offers": CISG makes offers irrevocable if it is explicitly specified or a time frame is given
- *Travelers Property Casualty Co v Saint-Gobain Technical Fabrics*: Whether a faulty product was governed under UCC or CISG btwn US and Canadian company; CISG applies

## Product Liability Torts

3 primary legal theories may be available: warranty (in UCC), negligence, strict liability

### Warranties

Express Warranties

- Originate from words/actions of seller
- Does not need to use the word "warranty": affirmation of fact or promise relating to goods, description of goods, providing sample/model of goods
- Does not include commendation or expression of opinion ("worth $x at retail!") -- some puffing allowed

Implied Warranties

- Impled Warranty of Merchantability
  - Goods are fit for the ordinary purpose for which such goods are used
  - Only applicable when the selling party is a merchant (ex: doesn't apply when you're selling your used car bc you're not a merchant of autos)
  - *Webster v Blue Ship Tea Room, Inc*: Patron choked on a bone in soup, sued for breach of implied warranty of merchantability; Fishbones aren't some foreign substance (fish wasn't tainted or a screw wasn't in the fish), so judgement for defendant
- Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Purpose
  - If the seller had reason to know that the buyer had some purpose for buying the product, and also knew that the product wouldn't fulfill that specific purpose (even if it was nowhere on the packaging or labels)
  - If the seller had "reason to know" of the particular purpose (a reasonable assessment), seller had "reason to know" the buyer was relying on the seller's skill or judgement, seller knew of these relevant facts BEFORE the sale contract is made
  - *Dempsey v Rosenthal*: Poodle with non-descended testicle was sold to buyer; sued seller in small claims court for breaching implied warranty of fitness, judge found for buyer bc trait could hereditary, and buying pure-bred probably means you intend to breed a dog

Warranties in Leases generally the same as Article 2

Warranties of Title

- If A buys goods B stole from C, A can:
  - Reverse transaction with B and return to C
  - Go to court with C
    - If won, then gets to claim legal fees from B
    - If lost, then returns to C and recoup legal fees and loss from B
- Goods must be free from any security interest or other lien/encumberance (ex: must disclose the fact that a house is mortgaged before sale)

- Warranties are cumulative (buyer doesn't have to choose one)
- Warranties can be voided if the seller includes a *disclaimer* in the contract, unless a court finds the disclaimer *unconscionable* under the UCC
  - Disclaimers of express warranties are pretty weak unless they're specific
  - Disclaimers of implied warranties
    - Can be written if it is "conspicuous" enough to be noticed by any reasonable person involved in the purchase, but it can be general like "no warranties beyond the description on the face hereof"
    - Disclaimer by examination if the buyer inspects the product before buying it/refuses to do so; disclaimer exists for *reasonably apparent* defects
  - Industry-wide trade customs can provide their own disclaimers among industry members, but not in dealing with nonmembers of the industry
 
Limitation on Damages:

- Basis-of-the-bargain damages (value of the goods less value received)
- Consequential damages (indirectly caused by the product)
- Buyer can rescind the contract
- Recovery can be limited to *liquidated damages*: specified amount to be paid in the event of a breach (such as replacing the product instead of money) unless they are *unconscionable*

Defenses

- *Privity Defense*: In the process of being eliminated due to today's economies-of-scale -- used to be that only the direct merchant/consumer could file suit
- UCC has allowed innocent bystanders hurt bc of faulty consumer's purchase to sue merchants
- Statute of limitations at 4 years, can be put down to one year with specific terms in contract, cannot be extended

## Negligence

- Seller has no duty to inspect unless they're offering a service of installing goods or in preparation for eventual sale; but they are responsible for taking reasonable measures to discover flaws created during production process
- *Duty to warn* if a product's design or intended use subjects the user to hazard or risk of injury

## Strict Liability

Deals less with negligence like warranties do, and more about whether the manufactured product is inherently faulty; much easier for plaintiffs to sue, so more common than warranty suits

Products must be in a defective condition when they leave the seller (burden of proof lies on the plaintiff)

*Knight v Just Born, Inc*: One of the Red Hot candies had bad syrup inside it that burned a customer's mouth -- customer sued Just Born, Inc and Costco (the retailer); got case heard

Economic Loss Doctrine: Draws strong line between tort liability and product liability (no injuries to anything/one other than the product itself)

*Red Rose Transit Auth v North American Bus Industries*: Purchased bus burned up a garage due to short in electrical system

Strict liability favors plaintiffs:

- Few defenses against liability can be raised by the defendant
- Disclaimers are ineffectual
- Privity is not required
- Buyers muts only prove the goods were *dangerously defective* when they left the seller's hands and that this defect caused the buyer's injury

Disadvantages:

- Only applies to merchants
- Availability of damages only for physical injuries to person or property, not economic injuries

## Federal Consumer Legislation

- Consumer Product Safety Act: Establishes Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) which covers all products except automobiles and food & drugs (FDA) -- max fine of $1.65 million on companies which isn't much, so mostly punish companies through bad publicity; recently been underfunded and staff cut
- Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act defines standards for warranties that ship with consumer products, usually enforced by the FTC

## Legislative Limitations on the Products Liability Revolution

60s - 80s saw a trend towards more protection for consumers, but it's shifted back as that resulted in higher prices and less competitive businesses

*Kurns v Railroad Friction Products Corporation*: Asbestos-related, affirmed by Supreme Court

*Pelman v McDonald's Corp*: Dismissed lawsuit against McDonald's for being over-the-top processed and unhealthy with many ingredients besides chicken or beef that the average consumer would not know of; failed, but caused some change within the co to become healthier
