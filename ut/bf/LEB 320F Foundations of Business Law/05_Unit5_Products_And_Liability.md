# Unit 5

LEB 320F

## Scope of Article 2 of the UCC

### Goods

Must be tangible and movable

- Real estate is not a good, but property tied to it that is sold is a good so long as it is removed as a part of the process and its removal does not cause material harm to the real estate
- Unborn animals, money treated as a commodity, products specially manufactured for buyers are all goods
- In determining good vs. service, courts try and gauge the primary intent of the buyer
- Food sold in restaurants are goods
- *Rottner v AVG Technologies USA*: Free software download to speed up computer ended up reformatting hard drive; AVG Technologies argued it was a service, not a good and motioned to dismiss -- denied because the way the software was offered via trial and sale was more of a good than a service

### Merchants

- Not just retailers, but also wholesalers and manufacturers -- anyone who "deals in goods of the kind"; only for their specific industries
- End consumer if they're going to use building materials to offer a service like constructing a house (building contractor) is a merchant
- Employing a merchant on your behalf/broker makes you a merchant
- *Brooks Cotton Co v Williams*: Williams (a cotton farmer) failed to deliver on a verbal contract with Brooks Cotton Co, enforceable only if both parties are merchants; farmers sell crops, therefore they are merchants

### Leases
