## Conflict in Organizations

**Substantive conflict**: Fundamental disagreement over ends or goals to be pursued

**Emotional conflict**: "Clash of personalities"; sources of conflict are feelings



**Interpersonal conflict**: Between 2+ individuals who are in opposition to each other

**Intrapersonal conflict**: Tension within the individual due to actual or perceived pressures from incompatible goals or expectations

- *Approach-approach conflict*: Person must choose between two positive and equally attractive alternatives
- *Avoidance-avoidance conflict*: Person must choose between two negative and equally unattractive alternatives
- *Approach-avoidance conflict*: Person must decide to do something that has both positives and negatives

**Intergroup conflict**: Conflict between different teams; cross-functional teams are a step in the direction towards fixing the situation

**Interorganizational conflict**: Market competition between companies, governments vs. unions vs. companies, companies and suppliers

**Functional conflict**: Results in benefits to individuals

**Dysfunctional conflict**: Works to the disadvantage of individual or team

Likely to have conflict when you combine different work cultures/ideologies

## Conflict Management

**Conflict resolution**: Situation in which the underlying reasons for dysfunctional conflict are eliminated

### Stages of Conflict

Conflict antecedents (conditions established) >> Perceieved conflict (even if only perceived by one of the parties involved) >> Felt conflict (tension that motivates action) >> Manifest conflict (expressed openly in behavior)

**Conflict resolution**: Removing or correcting antecedents

**Conflict suppression**: Conflict ignored/temporarily controlled, no change in antecedents

*Vertical conflict*: Involve supervisor-subordinate

*Horizontal conflict*: Between people working at the same organizational level

*Line-staff conflict*: About whether line or staff personell have control over budgets, technology, and HR practices

*Role ambiguity conflict*: Task expectations are not communicated clearly or they upset someone

Some causes for additional conflict:

- More team interdependence
- *Structural differentiation*: Different time horizons between teams
- *Domain ambiguities*: Misunderstood scope of authority

Sometimes conflicts just aren't able to be resolved:

Manager can *decouple* groups to help manage interdependence and required contact

*Buffering*: Inputs of one team are the outputs of another; increases inventory costs

*Linking-pin roles*: Liasons between conflicting groups/parties

*Upward referral*: Harnesses chain of command for conflict resolution

*Altering scripts and myths*: Conflict superficially managed by scripts (behavioral routines)

## Directly Dealing with a Conflict

**Avoidance**: No one acts assertively, simply pretend the conflict doesn't exist

**Accomodation**: Playing down differences between conflicting parties and highlighting similarities

**Compromise**: Each party shows moderate assertiveness and cooperation

**Competition**: Seek victory by force, superior skill, or domination

**Authoritative command**: Some leader dictates a solution

## Negotiations

*Two-party negotiation*: Manager negotiates directly with another person

*Group negotiation*: Manager is part of a team or group whose memebers want to arrive at a decision regarding a problem

*Intergroup negotiation*: Multiple groups negotiating with each other

*Constituency negotiation*: Each party represents a broader constituency

**Substance goals**: Deal with outcomes that relate to content issues under negotiation ($ in salary)

**Relationship goals**: How well people involved in negotiation will be able to work together once the process finishes

## Negotiation Strategies

**Distributive negotiation**: Positions staked out or declared by conflicting parties; each party trying to get a share of a "pie"

- "Hard" distributive negotiation: Each side holds out, competition ensues, most likely a win-lose scenario
- "Soft" one or both parties make concessions just to get things overwith, some latent dissatisfaction remains

**Integrative negotiation**: Try and increase the pie and find mutually agreed-on ways of distributing it

- Requires: willingness to trust, willingness to share information, willingness to ask concrete questions of the other party
- Advice
  - Separate people from the problem
  - Don't allow emotional considerations to affect the negotiation
  - Focus on interests rather than positions
  - Avoid premature judgements
  - Keep the identification of alternatives separate from their evaluation
  - Judge possible agreements by set criteria or standards

*Escalating commitment* if both parties start out stating extreme demands

*Overconfidence* develops that their positions are the only correct ones

*Telling problem*: Parties don't talk to each other trying to make themselves understood

*Hearing problem*: Parties are unwilling to listen enough to understand what the other is saying

*Alternative dispute resolution*: arbitration (with fill-in "judge"), mediation (third party encourages finding compromises)

**Bargaining zone**: Range between one party's minimum and the other party's maximum
