# Unit 1
LEB 320F

**Statuatory law**: Rules made by legislative bodies, not courts (written law)

Civil Law

- Plaintiffs bring cases against the defendants
- Contract law, tort law, sales law
- Among individuals, businesses, and sometimes government agencies
- Remedies
    - *Damages*: Cash sum paid to plaintiff roughly equivalent to their loss
    - *Injunction*: Court decree ordering a defendant to do or not do some specific thing
- Allegations must be true due to "a preponderance of the evidence"

Criminal Law

- Imposition of *fines* or *imprisonment*
- Crime against society as a whole
    - The government brings the case
- Criminal must be "beyond a reasonable doubt"
- *Felony*: Legislature has provided a max penalty of more than one year or death
- *Misdemeanors*: Carry lesser penalties
- Sometimes a citizen and a state could bring both a civil and criminal case

- **Public law**: Government-business or government-individual
- **Private law**: Between business and/or individuals

Justice is subjective, and perfect justice is often unobtainable. The law seeks to achieve *substantial justice*

## *Soldano v. O'Daniels*
Normally for a civil case, the jury is the "judge of the *facts*" whereas the judge decides the *law*, but a judge (for judicial efficiency) can grant a summary judgement and terminate the case before it is ever tried (no genuine issue of material fact). Trial judge for this case granted a summary judgement

Plaintiff appealed the judgement to the apellate courts

Appellate court ruled with the plaintiff:

**In the public-facing part of a business, if a Good Samaritan comes in during public hours citing a need to use the phone or request help and it doesn't impose a significant burden on the business, they must comply**

Grounded on the Common Law

## Court Systems

**Adjudication**: Fitting of rules to facts required for settling legal controversies

Trial courts deal with *fact and law* (what exactly happenned, and how does the law apply), whereas appellate courts deal with only *law*

### State Courts

#### Courts of Limited Jurisdiction
Mostly pretty minor matters, usually specialized (traffic, probate/estates, domestic relations)

#### General Trial Courts ("State Trial Courts")
Hear all cases except those covered by Courts of Limited Jurisdiction ("District Courts")

#### Apellate Courts
Hear appeals from judgments entered by courts below. Can have multiple layers or just one layer, but the top layer is always the state's supreme court

### Federal Courts

#### Specialized US Courts
Specialized hearings, such as the US Tax Court or US Court of Federal Claims (claims against the US government)

#### US District Courts ("Federal District Courts")
Only 94 in the entire country (most states have 1 - 4, depending on population). Only can hear cases related to Constitution and federal standards -- states' General Trial Courts are the catchall

#### Appellate Courts
13 Appellate Courts

- 11 of them blanket the country (different "Circuits" in different places)
- US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    - Appeals from Federal District Court for DC (no surprise here)
    - Appeals from rulings of federal administrative agencies
- US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
    - All appeals from patent applicants whose applications were rejected by the US Patent & Trademark Office
    - Appeals from patent infringement cases from US District Courts
    - Appeals from several other specialized courts

### Naming
Typically, the format is `[PLAINTIFF] v. [DEFENDANT]`, but as you appeal within federal courts (and some state courts), the appeallate's name goes first. Usually when there's multiple plaintiffs and/or defendants, you just list the first one

## Problems of Jurisdiction
A court must have both:

### Subject Matter Jurisdiction
States have their own laws regarding which cases go to which courts

#### Federal Courts
- Criminal cases in which a violation of a federal criminal statute is alleged (drug smuggling, threatening the president, SEC, etc)
- Civil cases are more strategic in filing state vs. federal court
    - Must raise a question of federal law
    - Even if there are multiple claims, if one of the claims is federal for the case, the federal courts take charge ("pendent" jurisdiction)
- Claim arising under the US Constitution creates **concurrent** jurisdiction -- can be heard by federal or state courts
- Claim arising from a federal statute is usually concurrent as well, unless the statute says otherwise (copyright, patent, antitrust, securities, etc)
- Opposite of concurrent is **exclusive**
- Usually a concurrent case stays in federal or state, whichever it was filed in, but if a case is concurrent and filed in state, it can be appealed from state supreme courts to The Supreme Court of the United States (if they accept the *writ of certoriari* that all of their cases require)

#### Diversity of Citizenship Cases
A type of federal case where no plaintiff and defendant are citizens of the same state (if one of each are in the same state, disqualified)

Amount in controversy must also exceed $75,000

Corporations are counted as citizens of both where they are incorporated and their principle place of business (if they're different)

**Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA)**: A few states (Illinois and Mississippi) became known for always settling against corporations in class-actions, so plaintiffs would always try to file there. CAFA allows class actions > $5 million to be transferred into federal courts by the defendants

## *Standard Fire Insurance Company v. Knowles*
Plaintiff filed in state court and claimed to seek < $5 million to keep it in Arkansas state court. Case made its way all the way up to the Supreme Court, despite the fact that all the claims added up > $5 million

**Stipulation vs facts**: Facts

- Stipulations must be binding. Knowles did not have the authority to cap off the claims of the other plaintiffs

### Removal from State to Federal Court
If concurrent federal-state jurisdiction exists, defendant can have the case moved to the federal district in the same geographical area

### Personal Jurisdiction
Plaintiff submits to personal jursdiction to whatever court by filing the case

Defendant's jurisdiction is validated mostly by following *procedural due process*:

1. Adequate notice
2. A meaningful opportunity to be heard (a hearing)
3. An impartial decision maker (judge)
4. In court actions, some substantial contact between the defendant and the *forum state* (state in which the lawsuit has been filed)

#### Appearance
Appearing doesn't just have to be showing up to court -- if any effort at defending is made beyond a *special appearance* (appearance for the sole purpose of arguing personal jurisdiction), then the defendant is submitting personal jurisdiction to the court

If a *special appearance* is made, but is denied, the issue can be brought up again in appellate courts

#### Service of Summons
It's most often the plaintiff's job to see that a copy of the formal notice of the lawsuit, typically along with the complaint, is delivered to the defendant *while the defendant is within the forum state* (or, defendant is resident of the forum state, there are other methods)

- Deliverer must be someone 18+ not directly related to the case, such as the law clerk in the same office as the lawyer, who swears that the delivery has happenned before the clerk

In some areas of the world, delivery is allowed via email, Facebook, Twitter, etc. In the US, it must be personally delivered unless the defendant says they're okay with dropping it off at place of work, mailing it, or giving it to someone 18+ at the same residence as them

Corporations have *registered agents* who can be served, and in some states, a ranking officer within the company

Supreme Court has ruled that even if the defendant is really good at avoiding an appearance, suit can still be count as served if the defendant has had "substantial contact" with the forum state in the past and a "significant effort" has been maintaind to reach the defendant at their out-of-state address

- States have adopted *long-arm statutes* that define substantial contact as per doing business in the state or having committed a tort (wrongful conduct for which civil liability can be imposed)
- Summons is sent (most often) to the secretary of state's office, which is then responsible to mailing it out-of-state
- Defendant must respond to the merits of the complaint or make a *special appearance* arguing there has not been substantial contact with the forum state
- Exercise of jursidiction over the nonresident must not offend "traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice"
- The internet is still being decided for personal jurisdiction, but in general, if your site is accessible and a transaction or tort occurs and angers a plaintiff, they get to choose and the state believes it has personal jurisdiction over the defendant

*Fraserside IP, LLC v. Youngtek Solutions, LTD*: Both porn sites. Youngtek is from Cyprus, but sued by Fraserside for stealing some of their videos and logos on their own site. Youngtek tried to argue personal jurisdiction and won. They don't have any servers in Iowan, only one previous paying Iowan customer, no manager has ever visited Iowa, etc

This is important because virtually every business in 2018 has some kind of at least passive website, which, if otherwise, would mean a business could be sued anywhere

#### Foul-ups
If for some honest mistake the service of summons did not make it to the defendant despite being delivered (ex: family member forgot to give it), then the defendant has 1 - 2 years (depending on the state) to appear before the court and undo the default judgement that resulted from their failure to appear

### *In Rem* Cases
Most lawsuits are in the *in personam* variety: plaintiff seeking judgement for damages or equitable remedy against the defendant

If the case is designated as *in rem* (dealing with property within the forum state), then personal jurisdiction is not required (subject matter still is, though)

- Common example: A bank forecloses on a mortgaged house. Subject of the case is the deed, not the defendant, so publishing a notice in a generally-circulated local newspaper is sufficient without obtaining personal jurisdiction
    - However, if the house's sale wasn't enough to cover the mortgage, then personal jurisdiction would be required for an *in personam* "deficiency judgement" to obtain money damages against the defendant whose house was taken to make up the difference
- Obtain lost or abandoned property, give government title to property that has been forfeited due to crimes (like drug dealing)

## Related Matters

### Venue
States get to make the rules of which county court within itself has the jurisdiction for a case for which the state has jurisdiction

- Usually within the county in which the accident/property was/is located
- If there are multiple venues acceptable, plaintiff gets to choose

### Forum Non Conveniens
A court may choose to transfer or dismiss a suit if another court is more conveniently suited to hear it

Can also be done internationally between countries

### Conflict of Laws
*Choice of law* designed to prevent plaintiff from shopping for best available court. Every state has their own (can also be applied internationally)

#### Contract Cases
Contracts typically will spell out something like "Cases arising from this contract will be tried according to California law"

If that clause isn't specified, a combination of factors are weighed, especially the state in which the contract was signed

Courts of Law
- Money damages
- Possession of real estate
- Possession of personal property

Court of Equity
- Injunction (ex: "stop letting your cattle graze on my land")
- Decree of specific performance (ex: "Live up to the contract to sell land")
- Divorce actions, mortgage foreclosure suits, actions for accounting by one member of a partnership against another, etc

Both have been combined to the same for courts of today, mostly decided by what the plaintiff is seeking

- No jury in an equitable action
- If both, then a jury can come up to give their view, but the judge is the ultimate decider
- Proceeding in equitable actions are less formal than those at law
- Equitable remedies are often tried to be avoided or given an alternative or all out dismissed by courts if
    - Plaintiff doesn't have "clean hands" (guilty of unfair conduct in dealing with the defendant)
    - An award of money damages would adequately redress the harm done
    - Granting of equitable remedy might interfere substantially with some third party
