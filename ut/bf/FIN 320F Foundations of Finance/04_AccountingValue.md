# Accounting Value

FIN 320F

**Accrual Method/Matching Principle**: Matches expenses (outflows) with revenues (inflows)

**Realization Principle**: Recognizes revenues when a contractual obligation occurs, despite any uncertainty about defaulting, etc.

**Cost Principle**: Record assets at cost, not market value

## Balance Sheet
**Accounting identity**: `Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder Equity`

Assets:

- Current assets (Short-term assets): inventory, easily convertible to cash
    - Cash
    - Marketable Securities (earn interest, but are easily convertible into cash -- treasury bills, commercial paper, certificates of deposits, etc)
    - Inventory
    - Accounts Receivable
- Long-term/Fixed assets: not easily convertible to cash; factory, vehicles, machines, nontangible (patentes, copyrights, goodwill)
    - Property, plant, equipment (recorded at purchase price)
    - Intangibles (brand, patents)
    - Long-term debt (bonds issued, nominal/face value)
    - Deferred taxes

Claims on assets:

- Current claims (Short-term claims): Short-term, must be paid within one year
    - Accounts Payable
    - Notes Payable (short-term loans from banks)
    - Accrued expenses (to-be paid salaries, subscriptions, etc)
- Long-term claims: Long-term debt, bonds which are in effect a special type of IOU issued to investors in return for cash

Shareholder equity:

- Shareholders are the owners, they get what is left over after all the liabilities have been satisfied

**Net Working Capital (NWC)**: `Assets that turn to cash within a year - Liabilities that must be paid with cash within a year`

**Equity**: How much the owners of the company actually own after measuring claims against assets (`Stockholder equity = Total assets - Total liabilites`)

- Preferred stock: Shareholders receive dividends before common stockholders
- Common stock: Normal shares of stock able to be bought by the public on an exchange

## Income Statements

3 key decisions that managers must make:

1. Product decision (what do we sell?)
2. Production decision (what productive assets will we obtain?)
3. Financing decision (how to obtain capital to finance?)

Balance sheet measures assets, claim, and equity. Income statement measures **performance** (how well the others are used). "Profit" = **Income**

`Income = Revenues - Expenses`

Variable costs are less risky than fixed costs, but less profitable

NOI = Net Operating Income = income from all operations

NPBT = Net Profit Before Tax = includes income not directly from operations (like interest on debt, selling off redundant machinery) = Net Earnings

When looking at income statement keep GAAP, cash vs noncash items, time and costs in mind

**Matching principle**: Match revenue with costs to produce them. Expenses + revenues are not matched and reported until the point of sale

**Earnings management**: Smoothing earnings reporting periods over multiple periods to avoid major dips and peaks

## Cash Flow

`$ Out - $ In`

### Cash Flow from Assets

`Cash flow from assets = Cash flow to creditors + Cash flow to stockholders`

- Operating cash flow: result of day-to-day producing and selling
    - Don't include depreciation (non-cash) or interest (financing issue), but do include taxes (since they're paid in cash)
- Capital spending: money spent on fixed assets - money earned from sale of fixed assets
- Change in net working capital: net increase or decrease in current assets over current liabilities

**Free cash flow**: Cash from assets the firm is free to distribute to creditors and stockholders (not needed for working capital or fixed assets)

*Cash flow to creditors*: Interest paid - net new borrowing

*Cash flow to stockholders*: Dividends paid - net new equity raised

## Taxes

**Average tax rate**: Percentage of income to taxes

**Marginal tax rate**: Extra tax you would pay if you earned an extra dollar

Depreciation is tax-deductible

## Financial Ratios

5 main categories: short-term solvency/liquidity, long-term solvency/financial leverage, asset management/turnover, profitability, market value

### Short-term Solvency/Liquidity

Current Ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities

Quick/Acid Test Ratio = (Current assets - Inventory) / Current liabilities

### Long-term Solvency/Financial Leverage

Total Debt Ratio = (Total assets - Total equity) / Total assets

Times Interest Earned (TIE) Ratio = EBIT / Interest

Cash Coverage Ratio = EBITD / Interest

(Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation)

### Asset Management/Turnover Measures

Inventory Turnover = Cost of goods sold / Inventory

- Measures how much of your inventory throughout the year you were able to sell; higher = better

Day's Sales in Inventory = 365 days / Inventory Turnover

- Gives an average for how long an item usually sits on the shelf

Receivables Turnover = Sales / Accounts Receivable

Days Sales in Receivables = 365 days / Receivables Turnover

- How fast collecting sales revenue (*ACP (Average Collection Period)* in days)

Total Asset Turnover = Sales / Total assets

- For every dollar in assets, we generated $x in sales

### Profitability Measures

Profit Margin = Net income / Sales

- Generates x cents in profit for every $1 of sales

Return on Assets = Net income / Total equity

- *Return on Equity (ROE)*: Measure of how well the stockholders did throughout the year

Earnings Per Share = Net income / Shares outstanding

Price-Earnings Ratio = Price per share / Earnings Per Share

Price-Sales Ratio

- Usually good for startups, who might not be profitable for a long time

Market-to-Book Ratio = Market value per share / Book value per share

Enterprise value = Total market value of stock + Book value of all liabilities - Cash

EBITDA ratio = Enterprise value / EBITDA
