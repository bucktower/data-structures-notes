# Unit 2
LEB 320F

US and England legal system is an **adversarial system**:

- Both parties get to decide for the most part how the trial is run
- If one side tries to introduce evidence that is not legally admissible, the judge won't try and stop it unless the other side objects
- If an attorney overlooks a legal argument, the judge usually won't try and correct it or present it
- In some states, judges can ask witnesses questions if they believe they're leaving out key elements, or make comments to the jury about some evidence presented
    - Judges will likely start to exercise more control in the future as the courtrooms become more crowded
    - *But* the key is that the adversarial hands-off approach is deeply embedded and the foundational idea won't change, rather than the:
- *Inquisitorial system*: Judges have more control over the trial and investigation, requiring more resources and time for people who have less of an incentive to be as thorough, but theoretically more about seeking the truth than strategic advantage and requiring less lawyers and resources from the private industry

## Pretrial Proceedings

### Pleading Stage
1. Plaintiff files complaint
    1. Request for a certain remedy
    2. Money damages and/or injunctions
        1. Remedy of rescission (ex: cancelling the contract)
        2. *Restitution* (ex: return of the purchase price)
2. Defendant files an *answer* (optional)
    1. Remember that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, defendant doesn't need to ever provide evidence to be found not-guilty
        1. If they do end up using evidence though: *affirmative defense*
    2. Some courts require denial of each claim individually, others allow a *general denial* of all claims
        1. All claims not denied are counted as admitted
    3. Can optionally include a counterclaim
        1. If it isn't directly related to this situation (*permissive* counterclaim), defendant can create a new lawsuit, otherwise it must be presented in this case as a counterclaim
        2. Both claim and counterclaim(s) can both be found valid/invalid, the resulting difference between the two (both sides paying money to the other) is balanced out at the end
3. Plaintiff files a *reply* (optional)
    1. Plaintiff will either deny or admit the new facts
    2. Very common if a counterclaim is raised

Defendant usually has ~20 days to respond, given the court has jurisdiction, starting when the defendant receives the summons and complaint

OR (not technically part of pleading)

1. Motion to Dismiss
    1. Law doesn't recognize the legal claim, even if the allegations were true (no "cause of action")
    2. Can be appealed by the plaintiff or defendant
2. Plaintiff recieves opportunity to amend the complaint
    1. Only really helpful if the attorney forgot to include something

How specific a complaint must be: "A short and plain statement of the claim"

*Ashcroft v. Iqbal*
- Iqbal was an Arab Muslim who plead guilty and returned home to Pakistan following 9/11 and being kept in max-security prison
- Case gave examples of racist treatment from prison facility, but named (former) Attorney General Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller as defendants in a racism case for creating a racist institution
- Motion to Dismiss was accepted by lower court and affirmed by Supreme Court
    - Very little evidence to suggest Ashcroft and Mueller intentionally and knowingly implemented a policy of racism in detaining suspected terrorists
    - It's only logical that many of the detainees would be Arab Muslim men because every single one of the attackers was one, and al Qaeda was also made up of them

### Pretrial Discovery
Both sides present most of the evidence they're going to rely on throughout the case

- Depositions
    - Testimony of a witness that is taken outside of court, under oath
    - Both parties must be allowed to be present and cross-examine
    - Purpose
        - Learn what the key witnesses know about the case
        - Gain leads that will help obtain additional information
        - Preserve the testimony of witnesses who might die or disappear
        - Establish a foundation for cross-examination of witnesses who might later change their stories
- Interrogatories
    - Written questions submitted from one party to the other that must be answered under oath
    - Good for gaining evidence solely held by the other party
- Requests for production of documents
    - Must make a legitimate effort to retrieve the documents
    - If found to not have made a legitmate effort, case can be dismissed altogether not in your favor
    - Courts are allowed to moderate costs so that one side can't use it as a strategic weapon against the other, since it does take resources to find specific documents

### Summary Judgement
If the plaintiff hasn't provided sufficient evidence for even one of the complaints in the lawsuit, the defendant can raise a summary judgement and the case will be dismissed (burden of proof)

Less commonly, the plaintiff can file a Summary Judgement and the case is dismissed only if the plaintiff's evidence is so clear and damning that there is no legitimate question that the defendant is guilty (defendant has failed to present any evidence that casts doubt or sufficient to create an affirmative defense)

## Litigation: Trial proceedings
Always a right to trial by jury, but if both parties waive the right (increasingly common in business disputes), the judge acts as the fact-finder and determiner in place of the jury and prepares "Findings of Fact" and "Conclusions of Law" after hearing the case

### Presentation of Evidence
Plaintiff has the burden of proof
- In civil, just have to convince more likely than not (*preponderance of the evidence*)
- Witness who gives false testimony is convicted of **perjury**

When a witness is called into court by the plaintiff's attorney, he gets to ask the questions first, but they cannot be leading questions (only brought to a halt by an objection from the defendant's attorney) -- **direct examination**

[UNLESS, the plaintiff's attorney is calling in an *adverse* witness, then they can ask leading questions]

Then, the defendant gets to conduct a **cross-examination**, to prove:
- Pertinent facts were omitted
- A witness' powers of observation were poor
- Witness made a conflicting statement in the past
- Witness is has something to lose/gain from the case's outcome

Judge may then grant a plaintiff a **redirect examination** to deal with any new matters brought up during the cross examination (judge could allow for yet another cross examination, but not usual)

Then it's the defendant's turn to present evidence and the roles are switched

#### Rules of Evidence
More stringent when there's a jury. Only enforced by objections from the other side

If one side can identify inadmissible evidence beforehand, then the judge can create an order not allowing the other side to try and sneak it in

Inadmissible Evidence:
- *Irrelevant evidence*
- *Hearsay*: Second-hand evidence ("I heard from another pseron X.../X said that this did happen")
    - Still allowed if for the purposes of serving truth ("I did hear X say he would sell the car to Y"), or going over ledgers/business records, etc.
- *Opinion*
    - Except in the cases of experts

### JMOL (Judgement as a Matter of Law/"Directed Verdict")
Defendant can ask a judge to render a ruling on a case because "reasonable minds could not differ"

Often denied, the defendant gets to make closing arguments, then plaintiff can make a request for JMOL, then present closing arguments, then defendant can make one final request for JMOL, but most often they're all denied


### Instructions to the Jury
- Refrainfrom discussing the case with anyone except other jurors until the case is over
- Not to speculate about the effect insurance coverage or attorney fees might have on the ultimate judgement
- Definitions of legal terms
- Court's charge to the jury
    - *General charge*: Outlines and explains the relevant legal principles to the jury, then asks them to find a verdict
    - *Special charge*: Series of yes/no questions to the jury, after which the jury must come to a verdict
    - Can (increasingly often) be mixed of both

*Riley v. Willis*: Judge left out important laws for jury

### After the Verdict
Either party can do one of two things:
1. A final request for a JMOL
    1. More of a "safety valve" for the judge in case the jury goes off, but almost never granted
2. A request for retrial


## Litigation: The Appellate Courts
Determine whether an material errors were made by trial court

Highest trial court: "Reviews the review" of the intermediate appellate court

*Appellant*: Party appealing

*Appellee*: The other party

Usually divide cases into 3 judges on each, judges working in rotation (except Supreme Court which has all for every case)

### Process of Appeal
Appellant's attorney files a notice of appeal and requests that the clerk of the trial perpare the *transcript* of the case and send it to the appellate court (costs money)

**Appellant's brief**: Sets forth errors that the appellant claims were made by the trial judge, then argues that those changed the ruling, responded to with the **appellee's brief** (trial judge's actions were correct, or harmless)

Oral arguments are permitted for usually several 30-60 min periods over the following two weeks. Court judges can ask questions

Appellate courts won't overturn just because they disagree with the reasoning or outcome of the judge/jury (appellate courts are second-hand/not in as good as a place)

Sometimes the trial judge makes written *conclusions of law* that the appellate court might overturn

*Affirming* the lower court's decision sends the case back down to be enforced

*Reversing* the lower court's decision can result in:
- Only requiring the judge to reconsider decision by applying whatever modified legal standard from the appellate courts (most common)
- Reverse the decision outright and order a contrary judgement
- Retrial

Passing the trial back down is called *remanding* the case

One judge who agrees with the majority opinion writes the official opinion, other judges (even if the agree) are allowed to write a concurring or dissenting opinion as well, although they have no outcome

*SEC v Ginsburg*: Ginsburg was a CEO who made unrecorded calls to family members shortly before they bought stock before his company bought up their shares and merged with them

- Appellate court ruled that the fact that the conversations weren't recorded doesn't mean there isn't enough evidence, so the jury can choose to convict based off of reasonable inferences

## Enforcement of Judgements
If the defendant is found guilty but doesn't pay/follow injunction/etc, the court fines and/or jails them

Sometimes cases never happen because the potential defendant isn't well off enough to even pay if they did lose

If the defendant refuses to comply, then the plaintiff asks the court for **writ of execution**: law enforcement seize property and sell it at auction until the value is made up

**Writ of garnishment**: Third parties like banks must deliver the defendant's property to the court (banks, stock brokers, debtors, etc), sometimes even wage garnishing in some states

Exempted property varies state by state, but most states prevent taking away the homestead (up to a certain value)

Can take action in other states if the forum state doesn't have any other resources (sometimes even other countries)

## Alternative Dispute Resolution (ARD)
*Negotiated settlement* just taking the loss because a trial isn't worth the resources and effort, or reaching a compromise

### Arbitration
Both parties settle on an arbitrator who makes an **award** (decision) that is legally binding, given that both parties signed that is the case beforehand

Courts usually will only overturn arbitration and require new arbitration (they don't review it) if there's been fraud or collusion with the arbitrator

**Labor arbitration**: Between companies and employees (usually labor unions)

- Taft-Hartley Act makes collective bargaining agreements, including arbitration provisions, legally binding

**Commercial arbitration**: All other forms of arbitration

- Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) makes written commercial arbitration agreements and arbitrator awards legally enforceable if the underlying business transaction affected interstate commerce, otherwise, its up to the forum state

Most major trading nations agree to enforce international arbitration agreements through treaties (1958 UN Convention on the Enforcement of Arbitral Awards)

Most arbitration agreements are *pre-dispute*: An clause in the contract in which the parties agree that they will submit that dispute to legally binding arbitration

Many states have adopted **court-annexed arbitration** for claims <$150,000. After the lawsuit is filed, companies must enter into arbitration with a panel of local attornies. After the arbitration, either party can request a normal trial.

*Oxford Health Care Plans LLC v. Sutter*: Supreme Court reaffirms arbitration: "the question for a judge is not whether the arbitrator construed the parties' contract correctly, but whether he construed it at all."

### Mediation
More of just someone in the middle trying to get the two parties to agree to something that is legally enforceable rather than sueing or arbitrating

Sometimes, you could have arbitrators that become mediators, an agreement is reached, and then they become arbitrators again to give legal grounds for enforcing the agreement

A few states do court-annexed mediation

## Sources of Law
**Stare decisis**: Following precedent to interpret the law

*Mandatory authority*: Precedent set by higher courts. The judge MUST follow this or almost surely be reversed

*Persuasive authority*: Authority from elsewhere that would be good to look to for guidance, but that isn't binding

*Flagiello v. Pennsylvania Hospital*: Stare decisis is not the end all be all. Sometimes rules need to be revisted

### Legislative Laws
Typical state constitutions:

1. Prohibit laws only affecting a portion of the citizenry
2. Requiring that the subject of every act be set forth in its title
3. Prohibit a statute from embracing more than one subject

Supreme Court mandates that every law must be understandable in ordinary English to be enforceable; cannot be "unconstitutionally vague"

Philosophy, history, custom, and social welfare are "directive forces" that shape the law

### Aids to Interpretation
1. Dictionaries and other reference sources
2. Textual context in the law or statute
3. Statute's legislative history
4. Statute's circumstantial context
5. Precedent

*Tennesse Valley Authority v. Hill*: Context for preservation of endangered species was very plain text that the species must be protected, whatever the cost. The dam to be cancelled because of a newfound species costed $53 million, but no exception was made because of previous comments from congressmen who helped pass it at the time

## Uniform State Statues
States are supposed to be "laboratories for democracy", but if every state has completely different laws, it makes it very hard for businesses.

Every state except Louisiana has fully adopted the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and many states model their corporate laws off of Delaware's
