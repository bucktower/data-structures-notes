# Physical Equilibria

## Phase Transitions

$\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S$

> **Sublimation**: Solid to gas
> **Deposition**: Gas to solid
> **Condensation**: Gas to liquid
> **Vaporization**: Liquid to gas
> **Melting**: Solid to liquid (also known as *fusion*)
> **Freezing**: Liquid to solid

- Becoming a solid => -$\Delta$H, -$\Delta$S
- Becoming a gas => +$\Delta$H, +$\Delta$S
- Becoming a liquid (you can imply the inverse reactions)

> **Enthalpy**: Energy in a system, lowered through attractive interactions (*H*)
> **IMF**: Intermolecular forces, energy is lower when molecules are together than when they are apart
> **Entropy**: Number of potential microstates for distributing energy, higher => state is more likely to occur (gases are typically higher than solids) (*S*)

- Balance between enthalpy and entropy is controlled by temperature
  - Lower temperatures => enthalpy dominates (thus mostly solids)
  - Higher temperatures => entropy dominates (thus mostly gases)

> **Free energy**: Combination of enthalpy and entropy (*G*)

- At any temperature, most stable phase is the substance with the lowest free energy

> **Spontaneous change**: Change that leads to a lower overall free energy

- At equilibrium, $\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S = 0$
  - $\Delta H = T \Delta S$

## Heating Curves

- Energy flowing in in the form of heat will
  - Raise the temperature if there is no chemistry (increase in kinetic energy)
  - Have the temperature remain constant if there are some chemical reactions (increase in potential energy, new state)

$q = \Delta H = m C \Delta T$

- $q$ = heat
- $\Delta H$ = enthalpy
- $m$ = mass
- $C$ = specific heat capacity
- $\Delta T$ = change in temperature
