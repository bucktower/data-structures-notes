**Selective screening**: Only a fraction of the information available we really focus on

**Schemas**: Cognitive frameworks that represent organized knowledge through experience. Common ones:

- *Script schema*: Appropriate sequence of events in a given situation
- *Self schema*: Information about a person's own appearance, behavior, and personality
- *Prototypes*: Pre-set bundles of features expected to be characteristic of people in certain categories or roles

**Impression management**: Crafting your image

**Projection**: Assuming others have the same values/likes/goals as you; projecting yourself onto others in a kind-of stereotype

**Contrast effect**: Standing out

**Self-fulfilling prophecy**: Create or find in a situation or individual what you intended to find in the first place

Internal attribution is under the individual's control; external attribution is beyond their control. Three determining influence which way it goes:

1. Distinctiveness: If unusual, then more likely to be external
2. Consensus: How likely are others to do the same when in the same situation
3. Consistency: Whether an individual responds the same way across time

**Fundamental Attribution Error**: Tendency to underestimate external factors and overestimate personal factors

- *Self-serving bias*: Deny personal responsibility for failure, but accept it for success

*Self-efficacy*: How fit you think you are to handle your job

*Classical conditioning*: Repetition

*Operant conditioning*: Teaching habits by manipulating consequences

- *Law of Effect*: Desirable outcomes will result in an action being repeated, whereas less desirable outcomes will do the opposite
- *Extrinsic rewards*: Positive outcomes that have some direct cost like a pay raise ("contrived") or no direct cost like a smile ("natural")
- **Organizational Behavior Modification (OB)**: Positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement (or avoidance), punishment, and extinction to get repeated desired actions in workplace/build good work habits

Positive reinforcement

- *Law of contingent reinforcement*: Reward is contingent on desired behavior
- *Law of immediate reinforcement*: Reward is given ASAP after good behavior

*Shaping*: Creation of new behavior by the positive reinforcement of successive approximations to it

Continuous reinforcement happens every time desired behavior occurs (pros: quickly build behavior, cons: behavior disappears quickly when stopped), whereas intermittent reinforcement only happens sometimes when the be (pros/cons are the opposite)

- Usually start with continuous reinforcement and shift into intermittent reinforcement

Intermittent reinforcement can be given on fixed or variable schedules:

- Fixed-interval: Certain time after behavior occurs
- Fixed-ratio: Each time a certain number of behaviors occur
- Variable-interval: random times
- Variable-ratio: Random times certain behavior occurs

**Extinction**: Completely withdrawing all feedback (ex: stop covering for a worker who's constantly late)
